<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> work which is now submitted to the judgement
of the public, in addition to other faults with
which it will no doubt be justly chargeable, may
be thought by many to be defective in arrangement;
and if the author had aimed to produce a
purely scientific work, he would consider such
charge as being well founded: but in making a
humble attempt to afford a popular view of the
present state of apiarian knowledge, historical,
physiological and practical, he conceived that he
should most effectually attain his object by mingling
the different departments together, particularly
where the two former would serve to illustrate
or explain the rationale of the latter. Moreover,
his first intention was not to offer much more
to the public than is contained in Part I. of the
work; but the materials grew upon his hands,
and consequently after that part was modelled, he
was induced by the very great interest which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">- x -</a></span>
excited in his mind by the prosecution of his inquiries,
to exceed the limits which bounded his
original plan:&mdash;the result will be found in Part II.
The subject would have admitted of still further
extension; but to have increased the volume beyond
its present size would have been to defeat
one of the objects of the author, which was so
to compress his matter as to place his book
within the reach of as many as possible of those
to whom he flatters himself it may prove practically
useful. Should the public, however, require
a second edition, and sufficing reasons urge him
to place this series of bee-knowledge under distinct
heads, he will endeavour to re-model it, as
well as otherwise to improve it, by such alterations
as ingenuous criticism may suggest.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span>lthough</span> the great addition which has of
late been made to our knowledge of the honey-bee,
may seem to render a reference to ancient
writers comparatively unimportant; yet
a few prefatory observations, upon the rise
and progress of apiarian science, may not be
out of season.</p>

<p>The natural history and management of
bees would probably occupy the attention of
man at an early period. Surrounded by
a boundless variety of living creatures, he
would naturally be led to notice their habits
and &#339;conomy; and no part of the animal
world, or at any rate no part of the world of
insects, would be more likely to engage his
consideration than the honey-bee. Honey
would, in all probability, constitute one of
his earliest luxuries; and as he advanced in
civilization, he would, as a matter of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">- xii -</a></span>
avail himself of the industry of its collectors,
by bringing them as much as possible within
his reach; and by this means he would take
an important step towards an acquaintance
with entomology. But the progress made by
our earliest progenitors, in this or any other
science, is involved in the obscurity and uncertainty
necessarily appertaining to the infancy
of society.</p>

<p>The first indications of attention to natural
history are contained in the Old Testament.
The interest which it excited in the mind of
<span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, evinces how highly it was esteemed
in his time. The records of its first progression
are however entirely lost, and no
regular history of this science exists prior to
the days of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, who under the auspices
and through the munificence of his
pupil Alexander the Great, was enabled to
prosecute with the greatest advantage, for
the time in which he lived, his experiments
and inquiries into every department of natural
history. Alexander felt so strong a
desire to promote this object, that he placed
at the disposal of Aristotle a very large sum
of money, and in his Asiatic expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">- xiii -</a></span>
employed above a thousand persons in collecting
and transmitting to him specimens
from every part of the animal kingdom.
<span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> is therefore to be regarded as
having laid the first foundation of our knowledge
of that kingdom. He must likewise
have derived great advantages from the discoveries
and observations of preceding writers,
to whose works he would probably have
easy access. No individual naturalist could,
without such assistance, have produced so
valuable and extensive a work on natural science
as that which Aristotle has bequeathed
to posterity. And though the opinions of
himself and his contemporaries have been
transmitted to us in an imperfect manner,
and abound in errors, still he and his editor
<span class="smcap">Theophrastus</span> may be regarded as the only
philosophical naturalists of antiquity, whose
labours and discoveries present us with any
portion of satisfactory knowledge.</p>

<p>The observations of Aristotle on the subject
of the honey-bee were afterwards &ldquo;embellished
and invested with a species of divinity,
by the matchless pen of <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>,&rdquo; in his
fourth Georgic; and it excites feelings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">- xiv -</a></span>
regret, that poetry which for its beauty and
elegance is so universally admired, should be
the vehicle of opinions that are founded in
error.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristomachus</span> of Soli in Cilicia had his
contemplations for nearly sixty years almost
solely occupied by bees; and <span class="smcap">Philiscus</span> the
Thracian spent a great portion of his time in
the woods, that he might investigate their
manners and habits without interruption;
whence he acquired the name of <i>Agrius</i>.
However small their contribution of knowledge
may appear to this enlightened age,
these ancient worthies must have aided the
early progress of their favourite science, and
are at all events evidences of the zeal with
which it was prosecuted in their day.</p>

<p>About the commencement of the Christian
&aelig;ra, <span class="smcap">Columella</span>, who was a very accurate
observer and exhibited considerable genius
as a naturalist, made some curious and useful
remarks upon bees in his Treatise <i>De Re
Rusticá</i>: but Columella, like Virgil, appears
to have acquiesced in and copied the errors
of his predecessors.</p>

<p>After him the elder <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> gave a sanction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">- xv -</a></span>
to the opinions which he found prevalent,
and added to them others of his own. But
Pliny, though a laborious compiler, occupied
himself with too great a variety of pursuits
to attain excellence in any. As a naturalist,
however, he is happy in some of his descriptions.
To him we are indebted for the transmission
to us of all that was actually known,
or supposed to be known, of natural history
in his day. I say&mdash;supposed to be known, for
many of the opinions and conjectures which
he has put forth, have been shown by modern
investigators to be ill-founded.</p>

<p>The notions of the ancients respecting
natural philosophy rested on no rational
foundation; ideas of charms and of planetary
influence directed their most important pursuits,
and led to the formation of very absurd
theories. When the writer last named recommends
that the dust in which a mule has
rolled should be sprinkled on persons who
are violently in love, as a sovereign remedy
for amatory ardour, and gravely tells us that
snakes are sometimes produced from the
human medulla,&mdash;with much nonsensical stuff
of the like kind; we may safely pronounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">- xvi -</a></span>
that he or his contemporaries or both were
very credulous, and that the science of experimental
philosophy was scarcely cultivated
among them.</p>

<p>After the compilation of Pliny&rsquo;s vast Compendium,
nearly fourteen hundred years rolled
away without anything being done for entomology
or for natural history in general.
<span class="smcap">The Arabians</span>, who alone preserved a glimmer
of science during those dark ages that
succeeded the fall of the Roman empire,
cultivated natural history only as a branch of
medicine, and from their writings little can
be gleaned in furtherance of our present
object.</p>

<p>On the revival of learning in the fifteenth
century, and after the discovery of the art of
printing, various editions were published of
the works on natural history, written by the Withers
of that science. <span class="smcap">Sir Edward Wotton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Conrade Gesner</span>, and others, produced conjointly
a work on insects, the manuscripts of
which came into the possession of <span class="smcap">Dr. Thomas
Penry</span>, an eminent physician and botanist
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. After devoting
fifteen years to the improvement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">- xvii -</a></span>
work, the Doctor died, and the unfinished
manuscripts were purchased at a considerable
price by <span class="smcap">Mouffet</span>, a contemporary English
physician of singular learning, who with
great labour and at great expense arranged,
enlarged, and completed the work. When
nearly ready for the press, he also died; and
the papers, after lying buried in dust and
obscurity for several years, at last fell into the
hands of <span class="smcap">Sir Theodore Mayerne</span> (<i>Baron
d&rsquo;Aubone</i>), a court physician in the time of
Charles the First, who gave them to the world
in 1634. The arrangement of this work is
defective; but for the period in which it was
written, it is a very complete and respectable
Treatise on Entomology. It was highly recommended
by Haller; and as a storehouse
of ancient entomological lore it has not yet
lost its utility. Its pages are embellished
with nearly 500 wood-cuts. An English
translation of it was published in 1658.</p>

<p>According to Fabius Columma, <span class="smcap">Prince
Frederic Cesi</span>, president of the Roman
Academy of Sciences, wrote a treatise upon
bees; but the work has not been preserved,
and we are unacquainted with its merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">- xviii -</a></span></p>

<p>These authors were succeeded by Goedart,
Swammerdam, Maraldi, Ray, Willughby
and Lister, who by their indefatigable exertions,
towards the close of the 17th century
threw very considerable light upon every
branch of natural knowledge. Goedart
spent forty years of his life in attending to
the proceedings of insects, &ldquo;daily conversing
with insects,&rdquo; as he expresses it, and published
in 1662 a work on their natural history; but
the plates with which it is embellished form
the best part of it. <span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span> published
his celebrated work, &ldquo;A General History of
Insects,&rdquo; in 4to, in 1669: a more enlarged
edition in two volumes folio, containing the
history of bees, was afterwards published
in 1737, under the auspices of Boerhaave,
from the manuscript of Swammerdam. Those
readers who have patience to wade through
these tedious volumes, will find it rewarded
by the attainment of much curious information.
<span class="smcap">Maraldi</span> published in the Memoirs of the
Royal Academy of Sciences for 1712, his
account of the manners, genius, and labours
of the bee. He is said to have been the inventor
of glass hives, and to that invention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">- xix -</a></span>
may be attributed the success of his inquiries.
Swammerdam founded his system upon what
has been called the metamorphotic basis; and
<span class="smcap">Ray</span>, in conjunction with his friend <span class="smcap">Willughby</span>,
whom he calls the profoundest of
naturalists and the most amiable and virtuous
of men, erected his superstructure on
the same basis. In the <i>Historia Insectorum</i>
of Ray, evidently the joint production of himself
and <span class="smcap">Willughby</span>, especial attention is
paid to the Hymenoptera: it contains various
interesting observations on their manners
and characters; and the descriptions, in which
he was assisted by the use of very powerful
microscopes, are concise and well drawn.
<span class="smcap">Dr. Martin Lister</span>, in an appendix to
Ray&rsquo;s work, and in various other writings
also, contributed materially to elucidate the
science of entomology. <span class="smcap">Madame Merian</span>
likewise deserves well, for her industrious
pursuit of this subject, particularly for her
beautiful illustration of the metamorphoses of
insects in Surinam.</p>

<p>The French natural historian <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>
stands prominent among the students of entomology,
for the unsurpassed enthusiasm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">- xx -</a></span>
accuracy with which he has investigated some
of its most intricate parts. To him the genus
Apis is under greater obligations perhaps
than to any entomologist either of ancient or
modern times. See his immortal work,
"Memoires pour servir à l&rsquo;Histoire des Insectes,"
in 6 vols. 4to. 1732-1744.</p>

<p>About this period also flourished the great,
the illustrious <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>, whose labours diffused
light over every department of natural
science, and have justly caused him to be regarded
as one of its brightest ornaments. He
has generally been considered as the founder
of the artificial system of arrangement; but a
very near approach to it was made by that
brilliant constellation of naturalists whom I
have enumerated as having flourished at the
close of the 17th century, and who may probably
be regarded as having paved the way,
and prepared materials, for the formation of
his more perfect system.</p>

<p>Afterwards appeared the works of the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> of Geneva, the admiring
correspondent of Reaumur, and the patron
and friend of Huber. This great physiologist
became addicted to the study of entomology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">- xxi -</a></span>
before he was seventeen years of age,
from reading <i>Spectacle de la Nature</i>; and his
decisive experiments upon Aphides do him the
highest credit. His works are universally
admired for their candour and ingenuity, as
well as for their manifest tendency to promote
the happiness of man, by exciting in him
the love of knowledge and virtue.</p>

<p>We now come to the physiological discoveries
of <span class="smcap">Schirach</span>, <span class="smcap">Hunter</span> and <span class="smcap">Huber</span>,
men who have wonderfully advanced the science
of entomology, by a series of experiments
most ably conducted, by the most
patient investigation, and the most accurate
and enlightened observation, and placed it
upon the solid foundation of rational induction.</p>

<p>Several other writers also, both in systematic
works and in periodical publications,
have contributed to throw much light upon
the &#339;conomy and habits of the bee. Of the
latter description in our own country may be
enumerated <span class="smcap">Arthur Dobbs</span>, Esq.; <span class="smcap">Thomas
Andrew Knight</span>, Esq.; Sir <span class="smcap">C. S. Mackenzie</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Rev. W. Dunbar</span>.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have referred to the writers on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">- xxii -</a></span>
natural history in general, or to the natural
historians of bees in particular: many writers,
however, have paid great attention to the domestic
management of these insects. Their
culture is indeed an object highly deserving
the attention of the agriculturist as well as
of the natural philosopher. In the hands
of a judicious and moderately attentive apiarian,
they may become a profitable branch
of rural &#339;conomy: even the most humble
cottager may be made to participate in the
benefit of an improved mode of managing
them: and as there is so much to admire in
their general &#339;conomy and peculiar habits,
the man of leisure may secure to himself a
source of pleasing and rational amusement
in the possession of an Apiary; for the pursuit
of apiarian science, in common with the
study of other branches of natural history,
leads to a salutary exercise of the mental faculties,
induces a habit of observation and
reflection, and may sometimes prove a valuable
resource for keeping off that <i>t&aelig;dium
vit&aelig;</i>, but too frequently attendant upon a
relinquishment of active life. No pleasure
is more easily attainable, nor less alloyed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">- xxiii -</a></span>
any debasing mixture; it tends to enlarge
and harmonize the mind, and to elevate it to
worthy conceptions of Nature and its Author:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"The men<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom Nature&rsquo;s works can charm, with God himself<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hold converse; grow familiar, day by day.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And form to his the relish of their souls.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Akenside.</span></p></div>

<p>In the following Treatise it has been my
endeavour to combine, as much as possible,
the profitable with the instructive and amusing;
in seeking which object, I have endeavoured
to clear the ground before me, of the
wild-flowers of conjecture and hypothesis,
with which the fecundity of the human imagination
has strewed it, and to substitute in
their place the less showy but more useful
products of experiment and rational deduction,
the growth of which it should be the
object of every labourer in the field of science
to promote. Always bearing in mind that
false theories often lead to erroneous practices,
I have carefully abstained from an indulgence
in theory of a merely speculative
kind, and confined myself simply to offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">- xxiv -</a></span>
such opinions to the attention of my readers,
as have been confirmed by repeated experiment
and observation, and to the recommendation
of such practices as have been found
useful by myself, or by others on whose reports
I can place the fullest reliance.</p>

<p>Among the writers who have improved
the domestic management of bees, may be
enumerated <span class="smcap">Warder</span>, <span class="smcap">White</span>, <span class="smcap">Thorley</span>,
<span class="smcap">Wildman</span>, <span class="smcap">Keys</span>, <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> and <span class="smcap">Huish</span>, all
of whom have devoted many years of their
lives to this important object. Persevering,
however, as have been the efforts of the before-named
writers to obtain an accurate
knowledge of the physiology of bees, and to
discover the best plan for their management,
there is still much to be learned in both these
departments, before the former can be thoroughly
understood, or the latter satisfactorily
regulated. I do not presume to imagine that
I can throw much light upon either of these
topics; but, judging from the difficulties which
I have myself encountered in collecting the
scattered materials of apiarian science, I think
that I shall confer a benefit upon future inquirers,
if I enable them to possess within a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">- xxv -</a></span>
moderate compass such information as can be
relied on. Strongly impressed by the importance
of the subject, I have for several
years devoted much of my time to its consideration;
and independently of the pleasure
I have experienced in the prosecution of it,
as a most interesting branch of natural history,
I have considered that by contributing
to extend and improve the culture of the bee,
I should assist in converting to useful purposes
some portions of those products of the
earth which might otherwise be dissipated in
the air, washed away by the rain, or chemically
changed by the action of various surrounding
substances, and in either case be
rendered comparatively useless.</p>

<p>Many of the tracts on bees are professedly
written for the perusal of the cottager.
To him I do not so particularly address myself,
as to the more intelligent members of the
community; and so far as I am able to succeed
in making an impression upon them, I
shall consider myself as virtually benefiting
the cottager. The latter is generally too
much of a machine to be the first to adopt any
improvement, however important; he is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">- xxvi -</a></span>
likely therefore to obtain bee-knowledge from
the example or <i>vivâ voce</i> instruction of his
enlightened neighbours, than through the
direct medium of the press.</p>

<p>How far I may have succeeded in the object
I propose to myself, I must leave to the
decision of my readers. It seems to be generally
admitted, that a Treatise exhibiting a
concise view of the present state of our knowledge
of the bee is much wanted; and this result
of an attempt to supply that desideratum
I now offer to the public, with a hope that it
may not be unworthy of its notice.</p>

<p class="caption2">HISTORY AND PHYSIOLOGY.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he Bee</span> is considered by Naturalists as belonging;
to what are called perfect societies of insects,
and, in entomological arrangements, is placed in
the order Hymenoptera, genus Apis. Of this
genus there are many species; Linn&aelig;us has enumerated
55; in the Dictionnaire des Sciences
Naturelles 70 species are characterized; and Mr.
Kirby, in his Monographia Apum Angli&aelig;, has
described above 220, natives of England. The
species to which I shall principally call the attention
of my readers is the <i>domestic</i> <span class="smcap">honey-bee</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">- 2 -</a></span></p>

<p>Every association of bees comprises three descriptions
of individuals; and each description is
distinguished by an appearance and cast of character
peculiar to itself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;First of the throng and foremost of the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One &lsquo;stands confest the sovereign and the soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This couplet may, to a limited extent, be applied
to other kinds of bees; but it is more peculiarly
applicable to hive-bees, as amongst them there
has never been found, in any single family, more
than one acknowledged regnant chief, usually designated
by the name of Queen; of whom, as
having the highest claim to our attention, I shall
first proceed to speak.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">queen</span>, who is at once the mother and the
mistress of the hive, differs, as Mr. Hunter has
observed, from the royal chiefs of other insects,
such as hornets, wasps and humble-bees; for the
chiefs of these latter societies seem to <i>work themselves
into royalty</i>, whereas the queen of the hive-bees
<i>reigns from her very birth</i>. She is distinguishable
from the rest of the society by her majestic
movements, by the great length of her body,
the proportional shortness of her wings, and her
bent sting. Her body tapers gradually to a point,
her fangs are shorter, her head is rounder, and her
trunk not half so long as that of the working bee.
Her wings extend only half the length of her
body, but are strong and sinewy. Her colours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">- 3 -</a></span>
also distinguish her as much as her shape; they
are much more distinct; the back is of a much
brighter black; the concentric rings on the under
side of her body are darker, and the lighter interstitial
part of the same region appears of a brighter
and more lively hue. The legs also are of a deep
golden yellow colour.</p>

<p>Next in order come the <span class="smcap">working bees</span>: these
are, by some, called <i>neuters</i> or <i>mules</i>; by others,
<i>female non-breeders</i>. From what will be said hereafter,
I think that my readers will consider the
latter as the more appropriate title, the workers
being sterile females with undeveloped ovaries.
In a single hive the number of these varies from
12,000 to 20,000: they are the smallest members
of the community, are furnished with a long flexible
proboscis, have a peculiar structure of the
legs and thighs, on the latter of which are small
hollows or baskets, adapted to the reception of
the propolis and farina which they collect, and
they are armed with a straight sting. Upon them
devolves the whole labour of the colony; they
rear the young, guard the entrances, elaborate the
wax, collect and store the provision, and build
the cells in which it is warehoused, as well as
those that contain the brood.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there are the <span class="smcap">drones</span> or <span class="smcap">males</span>, to the
number of perhaps 1500 or 2000. These make
their appearance about the end of April, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">- 4 -</a></span>
never to be seen after the middle of August, excepting
under very peculiar circumstances which
will be stated hereafter. They are one-third
larger than the workers, somewhat thicker and of
a darker colour; they have a shorter proboscis
and are more blunt at the tail than either the
queen or the workers; the last ring of the body
is fringed with hairs, extending over the tail and
visible to the naked eye. They make a greater
noise in flying and have no sting; are rather
shorter than the queen but much larger. Underneath
the tail two small protuberances of a yellowish
colour may be seen, which are regarded as the
distinctive marks of their sex. In some swarms
no drones are observable: probably these are
first swarms, which, being always led off by old
queens, have no occasion for drones, if there be
any truth in the theory to be hereafter stated.</p>

<p>Contrary to what occurs in the human species
and in other parts of the animal creation, among
bees, the females alone exhibit activity, skill, diligence
and courage, whilst the males take no part
whatever in the labours of the community, but are
idle, cowardly and inactive, and possess not the
usual offensive weapon of their species. The only
way in which the drones promote the welfare of
the society is a sexual one; and I shall endeavour
to show, in the course of this chapter, that they
serve no other purpose than that of impregnating
such of the young queens as may lead forth swarms
in the season, or be raised to the sovereignty of
the parent hive. As the drones are &ldquo;never seen
settling on any kind of flowers, nor laying up
honey in the cells, they most probably feed at
home, and fully answer the description given of
them by the poet:&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The elegant writer from whose unfinished poem, &ldquo;The
Bees,&rdquo; I have made the above quotations, was for many
years an eminent physician in Shrewsbury, but has now
retired into Wales, where I hope he will find sufficient leisure
and encouragement to resume the truly classical theme
which he has so nearly completed. Of the three parts which
have been already published, I shall frequently avail myself
in the course of this treatise, as well as of the highly interesting
notes which are appended to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">- 6 -</a></span></p></div>

<p>Mr. Morris of Isleworth, in the Transactions
of the Society for the encouragement of Arts, &amp;c.
for 1791, gives it as his opinion that the drones
&ldquo;<i>sit upon the eggs</i>, as the mother lays them;&rdquo; and
says that he has &ldquo;often seen them sit in a formal
manner on the combs, when the brood is hatching,
while the other bees were very busy at work.&rdquo;
I suspect that Mr. Morris mistook <i>sleeping</i> for
<i>brooding</i>, and that the drones were only taking a
nap. Fabricius says that insects never sit on their
eggs. Messrs. Kirby and Spence, however, have
observed that the female ear-wig does: they also
make one other exception in favour of the field
bug (<i>Cimex griseus</i>), but add that these are the
only ones. De Geer has given a very interesting
account of both these insects, particularly of the
strength of parental affection exhibited by the
females. The female of the former assiduously
sits upon her eggs, as if to hatch them, and after
they are hatched, broods over the young as a hen
over young chickens. And when the eggs of the
latter are hatched, she also, after the manner of a
hen, goes about with the brood, consisting of thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">- 7 -</a></span>
or forty in number and never leaves them: they
cluster round her when she is still, and follow her
closely wherever she moves.</p>

<p>Besides the three essential members of the bee
community, which I have just described, Huber
has called the attention of the Apiarian to a fourth
kind, which appear to be only casual inmates of
the hive, from which however they are soon expelled
by the workers. He has called them <i>black
bees</i>, and says he first noticed them in two of his
hives, in the year 1809, and on several other occasions
from that time to the year 1813. They
present a perfect resemblance to the working bees,
excepting in their colour, which, in consequence of
their being less downy, appears darker. On dissection,
their internal structure also appears to be
the same. Huber regards them as imperfect bees,
but leaves to future naturalists an inquiry into
their nature and origin. Messrs. Kirby and Spence
have thrown out a conjecture that these black bees
may be <i>superannuated bees</i>, that being no longer
capable of contributing towards the labours of the
community, are banished or destroyed by its
younger members. They found their conjecture
upon the usual effect of superannuation in rubbing
off the hair of insects and thereby giving
them a darker hue.</p>

<p>It is the office of the queen-bee to lay eggs,
which she deposits in cells constructed for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">- 8 -</a></span>
reception by the working bees. These cells vary
from one another in size, (and in the instance of the
royal cells, they also vary in form), according as
they are intended to be the depositories of eggs
that are to become drones, or of those that are
to become workers. But for a more particular
account of these cells, <i>Vide</i> Part II. "<a href="#Architecture">Architecture
of Bees</a>." The Rev. W. Dunbar, minister
of Applegarth, who has recently added some important
particulars to our general stock of knowledge
respecting bees, states that when the queen
is about to lay, she puts her head into a cell, and
remains in that position for a second or two, probably
to ascertain its fitness for the deposit which
she is about to make. She then withdraws her
head, and curving her body downwards, inserts
her tail into the cell: in a few seconds she turns
half round upon herself and withdraws, leaving an
egg behind her. When she lays a considerable
number, she does it equally on each side of the
comb, those on the one side being as exactly opposite
to those on the other, as the relative position
of the cells will admit. The effect of this is
to produce a concentration and &#339;conomy of heat
for developing the various changes of the brood.
The following sketch is taken from a plate given
by Mr. Dunbar in the Edinburgh Philosophical
Magazine, to represent the comb upon which his
observations were made, and to show that part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">- 9 -</a></span>
it which was occupied by brood, the surrounding
part of the square being full of sealed honey.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>eggs</i> of bees are of a lengthened oval shape,
with a slight curvature, and of a blueish white
colour: they are composed of a thin membrane,
filled with a whitish liquor, and being besmeared,
at the time of laying, with a glutinous substance,
they adhere to the bases of the cells, where they
stand upright, and remain unchanged in figure or
situation for four days; they are then hatched,
the bottom of each cell presenting to view a small
white worm or maggot, with several ventral rings.
On its growing, so as to touch the opposite angle
of the cell, it coils itself up in the shape of a semicircle,
and floats in a whitish transparent fluid, by
which it is probably nourished and enlarged in its
dimensions, till the two extremities touch one another
and form a ring. In this state it obtains indifferently
the name of <i>worm</i>, <i>larva</i>, <i>maggot</i> or <i>grub</i>,
and is fed with farina or bee-bread, to receive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">- 10 -</a></span>
welcome morsels of which, it eagerly opens its two
lateral pincers. It is the opinion of Reaumur and
others that farina does not constitute the sole food
of the bee-larv&aelig;, but that it consists of a mixture
of farina with a certain proportion of honey and
water, partly digested in the stomachs of the <i>nursing</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
<i>bees</i>, the relative proportions of honey and
farina varying according to the age of the young.
It is insipid whilst they are very young, and becomes
sweeter and more acescent the nearer they
approach maturity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> For an account of these see Part II. &ldquo;Nature and
Origin of Bees-wax.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Schirach imagined that the semen of the male
was the food of the larv&aelig;: Bonnet entertained
the same opinion, founded upon his observation
that the drones, in going across the combs, pass
by those cells that contain no maggots, but stop
at those which do, giving a knock with the tail at
them three times. Upon this Mr. Hunter observes
that <i>three</i> is a famous number! and we know very
well that the development is complete in hives
that do not contain a single drone.</p>

<p>The larva having derived support in the manner
above described, for four, five or six days,
according to the season<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, continues to increase
during that period, till it occupies the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">- 11 -</a></span>
breadth and nearly the length of the cell. The
nursing-bees now seal up the cell, with a light
<i>brown</i> cover, externally more or less <i>convex</i>, (the
cap of a drone-cell is more convex than that of a
worker,) and thus differing from that of a honey-cell,
which is <i>paler</i> and somewhat <i>concave</i>. It is
no sooner perfectly inclosed than it begins to labour,
alternately extending and shortening its
body, whilst it lines the cell by spinning round
itself, after the manner of the silk-worm, a whitish
silky film or <i>cocoon</i>, by which it is encased, as it
were, in a pod or pellicle. &ldquo;The silken thread
employed in forming this covering, proceeds from
the middle part of the under lip, and is in fact
composed of two threads gummed together as
they issue from the two adjoining orifices of the
spinner<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>.&rdquo; When it has undergone this change,
it has usually borne the name of <i>nymph</i> or <i>pupa</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Schirach asserts, that in cool weather the development
takes place two days later than in warm.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Kirby and Spence.</p></div>

<p>It may appear somewhat extraordinary that a
creature which takes its food so voraciously prior
to its assuming the pupa state, should live so long
without food, after that assumption: but a little
consideration will perhaps abate our wonder; for
when the insect has attained the state of pupa, it
has arrived at its full growth, and probably the
nutriment, taken so greedily, is to serve as a store
for developing the perfect insect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">- 12 -</a></span></p>

<p>The bee, when in its pupa state, has been denominated,
but improperly, <i>chrysalis</i> and <i>aurelia</i>;
for these, as the words import, are of a golden
yellow colour and they are crustaceous; whilst
the bee-nymphs appear of a pale, dull colour, and
readily yield to the touch. The golden splendour,
to which the above names owe their origin, is
peculiar to a certain species only of the papilio or
butterfly tribe. The higher class of entomologists,
following the example of Linn&aelig;us, apply
the term pupa to this state of the embryo bee, a
term which signifies that the insect is enveloped
in swaddling clothes like an infant, a very apt
comparison. Kirby and Spence have remarked
that it exhibits no unapt representation of an
Egyptian mummy. Huber&rsquo;s translator says that
naturalists of the present day incline to use the
name of larva, in all cases where the worm is not
seen under its final aspect.</p>

<p>The <i>working bee-nymph</i> spins its cocoon in
thirty-six hours. After passing a certain period in
this state of preparation for a new existence, it gradually
undergoes so great a change, as not to wear
a vestige of its previous form, but becomes armed
with a firmer mail, and with scales of a dark brown
hue, fringed with light hairs. On its belly six
rings become distinguishable, which by slipping
one over another, enable the bee to shorten its
body whenever it has occasion to do so; its breast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">- 13 -</a></span>
becomes entirely covered with gray feather-like
hairs, which as the insect advances in age assume
a reddish hue.</p>

<p>When it has reached the twenty-first day of its
existence, counting from the moment the egg is
laid, it quits the exuvi&aelig; of the pupa state, comes
forth a perfect winged insect, and is termed an
<i>imago</i>. The cocoon or pellicle is left behind and
forms a closely attached and exact lining to the
cell in which it was spun: by this means the breeding-cells
become smaller, and their partitions
stronger, the oftener they change their tenants;
and when they have become so much diminished
in size, by this succession of pellicles or linings,
as not to admit of the perfect development of full-sized
bees, they are converted into receptacles for
honey.</p>

<p>Such are the respective stages of the working
bee; those of the royal bee are as follow. She
passes three days in the egg and is five a worm;
the workers then close her cell<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, and she immediately
begins spinning the cocoon, which occupies
her twenty-four hours. On the tenth and eleventh
days, as if exhausted by her labour, she remains in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">- 14 -</a></span>
complete repose, and even sixteen hours of the
twelfth. Then she passes four days and one-third
as a nymph. It is on the sixteenth day therefore
that the perfect state of queen is attained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Instead of being nearly horizontal like the other brood-cells,
those of the queens are perpendicular and considerably
larger; in form they are oblong spheroids, tapering gradually
downwards; their mouths being always at the bottom.
<i>Vide</i> Part II. &ldquo;<a href="#Architecture">Architecture of Bees</a>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The male passes three days in the egg, six and
a half as a worm, and metamorphoses into a fly
on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth day, after the
egg is laid. The great epoch of laying the eggs
of males may be accelerated or retarded by the
state of the atmosphere promoting or impeding
the collections of the bees. The <i>development</i> of
<i>each</i> species likewise proceeds more slowly when
the colonies are weak or the air cool, and when
the weather is very cold it is entirely suspended.
Mr. Hunter has observed that the eggs, maggots
and nymphs, all require a heat above 70&deg; of Fahrenheit
for their evolution. The influence of temperature
in developing embryo insects is very
strongly illustrated in the case of the <i>Papilio
Machaon</i>. According to Messrs. Kirby and Spence,
&ldquo;if the caterpillar of the <i>Papilio Machaon</i> becomes
a pupa in July, the butterfly will appear in
thirteen days; if it do not become a pupa till
September, the butterfly will not make its appearance
until the following June.&rdquo; And this is
the case, say they, with a vast number of other
insects. Reaumur proved the influence of temperature,
by effecting the regular changes in a
hot-house, during the month of January. He also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">- 15 -</a></span>
proved it conversely, by having recourse to an
ice-house in summer, which enabled him to retard
the development for a whole year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The larv&aelig; of bees, though without feet, are
not always without motion. They advance from
their first station at the bottom of the cell, in a
spiral direction: this movement, for the first three
days, is so slow as to be scarcely perceptible; but
after that it is more easily discerned. The animal
now makes two entire revolutions, in about an
hour and three quarters; and when the period of
its metamorphosis arrives, it is scarcely more than
two lines from the mouth of the cell. Its attitude,
which is always the same, is a strong curve. This
occasions the inhabitant of a horizontal cell to be
always perpendicular to the horizon, and that of
a vertical one to be parallel with it<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Kirby and Spence.</p></div>

<p>The young bees break their envelope with their
teeth, and, assisted at first by the working-bees,
proceed to cleanse themselves from the moisture
and exuvi&aelig; with which they were surrounded:
this operation being completed, they begin to
exercise their intended functions, and in a few minutes
are gathering provision in the fields, loading
&ldquo;in life&rsquo;s first hour the hollow&rsquo;d thigh.&rdquo; M. Maraldi
assures us that he has &ldquo;seen bees loaded
with two large balls of wax, returning to the hive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">- 16 -</a></span>
the same day they became bees.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have
seen her,&ldquo; says Wildman, &rdquo;the same day issue
from the cell, and return from the fields loaded
with wax, like the rest.&ldquo; The error of Maraldi
and Wildman in using the term wax instead of
pollen, does not at all affect the accuracy of their
observations. As soon as the young insect has
been licked clean and regaled with a little honey
by its companions, the latter clean out the cell,
preparatory to its being re-occupied by a new
tenant or with honey.</p>

<p>With respect to the cocoons spun by the different
larv&aelig;, both workers and drones spin <i>complete
cocoons</i>, or inclose themselves on every
side: royal larv&aelig; construct only <i>imperfect cocoons</i>,
open behind, and enveloping only the head, thorax,
and first ring of the abdomen; and Huber concludes,
without any hesitation, that the final cause
of their forming only incomplete cocoons is that
they may thus be exposed to the mortal sting of
the first hatched queen, whose instinct leads her
instantly to seek the destruction of those who
would soon become her rivals. If the royal larv&aelig;
spun complete cocoons, the stings of the queens
regnant might be so entangled in their silken
meshes, as to be with difficulty disengaged from
them. &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; says Huber, &ldquo;is the <i>instinctive
enmity of young queens to each other</i>, that I have
seen one of them, immediately on its emergence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">- 17 -</a></span>
from the cell, rush to those of its sisters, and tear
to pieces even the imperfect larv&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A curious circumstance occurs with respect
to the hatching of the queen-bee. When the
pupa or nymph is about to change into the
perfect insect, the bees render the cover of the
cell thinner, by gnawing away part of the wax;
and with so much nicety do they perform this
operation that the cover at last becomes pellucid,
owing to its extreme thinness, thus facilitating
the exit of the fly. After the transformation is
complete, the young queens would, in common
course, immediately emerge from their cells, as
workers and drones do; but the former always
keep the royal infants prisoners for some days,
supplying them in the mean time with honey for
food, a small hole being made in the door of each
cell, through which the confined bee extends its
proboscis to receive it. The <i>royal prisoners</i> continually
utter a kind of song, the modulations of
which are said to vary. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter <span class="smcap">XV</span></a>. Huber
heard a young princess in her cell emit a very
distinct sound or clacking, consisting of several
monotonous notes in rapid succession, and he supposes
the working bees to ascertain, by the loudness
of these tones, the ripeness of their queens.
Huber has suggested that the cause of this temporary
imprisonment may possibly be to enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">- 18 -</a></span>
the young queens to fly away at the instant they
are liberated.</p>

<p>The queen is a good deal harassed by the other
bees, on her liberation. This has been attributed
to their wishing to impel her to go off with a
swarm as soon as possible, but this notion is
probably erroneous; it certainly is so if Huber be
correct, in saying that the swarms are always
accompanied by the older queens. The queen
has the power of instantly putting a stop to their
worrying, by uttering a peculiar noise, which has
been called the <i>voice of sovereignty</i>. Bonner however
declares that he never could observe in the
queen anything like an exercise of sovereignty.
But Huber&rsquo;s statement was not founded upon a
solitary instance; he heard the sound on various
occasions, and witnessed the striking effect which
it always produced. On one occasion, a queen
having escaped the vigilance of her guards and
sprung from the cell, was, on her approach to the
royal embryos, pulled, bitten and chased by the
other bees. But standing with her thorax against
a comb and crossing her wings upon her back,
keeping them in motion, but not unfolding them,
she emitted a particular sound, when the bees
became, as it were, paralysed and remained motionless.
Taking advantage of this dread, she rushed
to the royal cells; but the sound having ceased as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">- 19 -</a></span>
she prepared to ascend, the guardians of the cells
instantly took courage and fairly drove her away.
This voice of sovereignty, as it has been called,
resembles that which is made by young queens
before they are liberated from their cells; it is a
very distinct kind of clicking, composed of many
notes in the same key, which follow each other
rapidly. The sound accompanied by the attitude
just described, always produces a paralysing effect
upon the bees.</p>

<p>Bees, when deprived of their queen, have the
power of selecting one or more grubs of workers,
and converting them into queens. To effect this,
each of the promoted grubs has a royal cell or
cradle formed for it, by having three contiguous
common cells thrown into one; two of the three
grubs that occupy those cells are sacrificed, and
the remaining one is liberally fed with royal jelly.
This <i>royal jelly</i> is a pungent food prepared by the
working bees, exclusively for the purpose of feeding
such of the larv&aelig; as are destined to become
candidates for the honours of royalty, whether it
be their lot to assume them or not. It is more
stimulating than the food of ordinary bees, has not
the same mawkish taste, and is evidently acescent.
The royal larv&aelig; are supplied with it rather profusely,
and there is always some of it left in the
cell, after their transformation. Schirach, who
was secretary to the Apiarian Society in Upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">- 20 -</a></span>
Lusatia and vicar of Little Bautzen, may be regarded
as the discoverer, or rather as the promulgator
of this fact; and his experiments, which
were also frequently repeated by other members
of the Lusatian Society, have been amply confirmed
by those of Huber and Bonner. Mr. Keys
was a violent sceptic upon this subject (See his
communications to the Bath Society); so likewise
was Mr. Hunter (<i>Vide</i> Philosophical Transactions).
But notwithstanding the criticisms and ridicule of
the former, and the sarcastic strictures of the latter,
the sex of workers is now established beyond all
doubt. The fact is said to have been known long
before Schirach wrote: M. Vogel and Signor Monticelli,
a Neapolitan professor, have both asserted
this; the former states it to have been known upwards
of fifty years, the latter a much longer
period; he says that the Greeks and Turks in the
Ionian Islands are well acquainted with it, and that
in the little Sicilian island of Favignana, the art
of <i>producing queens</i> has been known from very
remote antiquity; he even thinks that it was no
secret to the Greeks and Romans, though, as
Messrs. Kirby and Spence observe, had the practice
been common, it would surely have been noticed
by Aristotle or Pliny. The result of Schirach&rsquo;s
experiments was that all workers were originally
females, but that their organs of generation
were obliterated, merely because the germs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">- 21 -</a></span>
them were not developed; their being fed and
treated in a particular manner, in their infancy
or worm state, being necessary, in his opinion,
to effect that development. Subsequent experiments
conducted under the auspices of Huber,
have shown, however, that the organs are not entirely
obliterated.</p>

<p>Huber has been regarded as a man of a very
vivid imagination; and as his eye-sight was defective,
he was obliged to rely very much upon the
reports of Francis Burnens, his assistant; on both
which accounts other apiarian writers have thrown
some distrust upon his statements. Huish may
be reckoned among the number; he has also made
some observations upon Schirach&rsquo;s theory, and
treated it with much petulance and ridicule. In
answer to him and all other cavillers, I shall detail
an experiment made by Mr. Dunbar, in his mirror
hive. In July, when the hive had become filled
with comb and bees, and well stored with honey;
and when the queen was very fertile, laying a
hundred eggs a-day, Mr. D. opened the hive and
took her majesty away. The bees laboured for
eighteen hours before they appeared to miss her;
but no sooner was the loss discovered than all was
agitation and tumult; and they rushed in crowds
to the door, as if swarming. On the following
morning he observed that they had founded five
queen cells, in the usual way under such circumstances;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">- 22 -</a></span>
and in the course of the same afternoon,
four more were founded, in a part of the
comb where there were only eggs a day or two
old. On the fourteenth day from the old queen&rsquo;s
removal, a young queen emerged and proceeded
towards the other royal cells, evidently with a
murderous intent. She was immediately pulled
away by the workers, with violence, and this conduct
on their part was repeated as often as the
queen renewed her destructive purpose. At every
repulse she appeared sulky, and cried <i>peep peep</i>,
one of the unhatched queens responding, but in a
somewhat hoarser tone. (This circumstance affords
an explanation of the two different sounds which
are heard, prior to the issuing of second swarms.)
On the afternoon of the same day, a second queen
was hatched; she immediately buried herself in a
cluster of bees. Next morning Mr. D. observed
a hot pursuit of the younger queen by the elder,
but being called away, on his return half an hour
afterwards, the former was dying on the floor, no
doubt the victim of the other. Huber has stated
that these artificial queens are mute; but the circumstance
noticed by Mr. Dunbar of the two
queens, just referred to, having answered each
other, disproves that statement. Contrary also to
the experience of Huber, Mr. D. found that the
cells of artificial queens were surrounded by a
guard. I have just adverted to the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">- 23 -</a></span>
which they afforded to the royal cells, when assailed
by the first hatched queen.</p>

<p>That <i>the working bees are females</i> is clear from
the circumstance of their being known occasionally
to lay eggs. This fact was first noticed by Riem,
and was afterwards confirmed by the experiments
of Huber, whose assistant, on one occasion seized
a fertile worker in the very act of laying. It is a
remarkable fact that these <i>fertile workers</i> never lay
any but <i>drones&rsquo;</i> eggs. This uninterrupted laying
of drones&rsquo; eggs was noticed by the Lusatian observers,
as well as by the naturalist of the Palatinate.
Bonnet, on referring to this fact, supposes
there must have been small queens mixed with the
workers upon which the experiments were made,
whose office it was to lay male eggs in <i>all</i> hives;
for neither he nor the before-named observers
imagined that the workers were ever fertile, though
from the oft repeated experiments, just alluded to,
they must have regarded them as females. Probably
the fertility of these workers is occasioned
by some royal jelly being casually dropped into
their cells, when grubs, as they uniformly issue
from cells adjoining those inhabited by grubs, that
have been raised from the plebeian to the royal
rank; of course therefore they are never found in
any hives but those which have had the misfortune
to lose their queen. Fertile workers appear
smaller in the belly and more slender in the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">- 24 -</a></span>
than sterile workers, and this is the only external
difference between them.</p>

<p>If any further proof were required to establish
the opinion that working bees are females, the
question has been set at rest for ever, by <i>the dissections
of Miss Jurine</i>, daughter of the distinguished
naturalist of Geneva: what had eluded
the scalpel and the microscope of that penetrating
and indefatigable naturalist Swammerdam, was
reserved for the still finer hand and more dexterous
dissection of a lady. Miss Jurine, by adopting a
particular method of preparing the object to be
examined, brought into view the rudiments of the
ovaria of the common working bee: her examinations
were several times repeated, and always with
success: in form, situation and structure, they were
found to be perfectly analogous to those of the queen-bee,
excepting that no ova could be distinguished
in them. M. Cuvier, however, thinks that he has
observed minute chaplets in common bees, resembling
those in the oviducts of queens; an additional
confirmation, if any were wanted, of the
opinion that workers are females whose organization
is not developed. Miss Jurine undertook the
delicate task to which I have just referred, at the
request of M. Huber, who speaks of her as a
young lady who had devoted her time and the
liberal gifts of nature to similar studies, and says
that she already rivalled Lyonnet and Merian; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">- 25 -</a></span>
adds, &ldquo;we had soon to deplore her loss.&rdquo; The
research was first made to ascertain whether black
bees, which, when they appear in a hive, are much
persecuted, were exposed to this persecution in
consequence of their sex exciting the jealousy of
the queen. The success of the investigation induced
this accomplished young lady to extend her
dissection to the common workers, which was
crowned with a result equally gratifying. Parallel
instances have been observed with regard to the
humble-bee, the wasp and the ant, amongst which,
those that have usually been called neuters are
found to be females, and when fertile, they, like
the fertile workers in a bee-hive, produce males
universally.</p>

<p>Having now traced these insects through their
regular stages of egg, larva, nymph, until they
become perfect bees, and having noticed the facts
which show the working bees to be females, I
shall advert to the more intricate and mysterious
business of <i>Impregnation</i>. This is a subject which
was long involved in obscurity, and which indeed
is still clouded by some uncertainty. Schirach
and Bonner stoutly denied the necessity of sexual
intercourse between the queen and the drones,
considering the former as a mother and yet a
virgin, and Swammerdam was of the same opinion;
he ascribes impregnation to a vivifying seminal
aura, which is exhaled from the drones and penetrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">- 26 -</a></span>
the body of the queen. This opinion arose
from his observing a very strong odour to be exhaled,
at certain times, from the drones; &ldquo;Hanc
sententiam ratam habuit, quia organa apum propagini
servientia, sexus utriusque, ritè dissecta, inter
se ita disparia videbantur, ut congressus ne fieri
quidem ullo pacto posset.&rdquo; His opinion with respect
to the vivifying influence of the seminal aura
also accounted satisfactorily, to his own mind,
for there being such a prodigious number of
drones, as, in proportion to their number, would
of course be the intensity of their peculiar
odour. Reaumur very successfully combated
this fanciful doctrine, and Huber has confuted
it by direct experiment. Reaumur inclined to
the opinion that there was a sexual intercourse,
though his experiments left that question undecided.
Arthur Dobbs, Esq. has given it as his
opinion that the queen&rsquo;s eggs were impregnated
by coition with the drones, and that a renewal of
the intercourse was unnecessary. He however
thought that she had intercourse with several,
instead of with one only, in order that there might
be a sufficient deposition of sperm to impregnate
all her eggs. About the beginning of the last
century, Maraldi broached another hypothesis;
he imagined that the eggs were fecundated by the
drones, after the queen had deposited them in the
cells, similarly to what takes place in the fecundation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">- 27 -</a></span>
of fish-spawn. In 1777 that ingenious
naturalist Mr. Debraw, who was apothecary to
Addenbroke&rsquo;s Hospital at Cambridge, also adopted
this opinion; and even so late as the year 1817
Huish has supported the same doctrine, and I
believe does so at the present time. Debraw
thought he had discovered the prolific fluid of the
drones, in the brood-cells, which fertilizing the
eggs caused them to produce larv&aelig;. Huber repeated
the experiments of Debraw, and at first
gave him credit for the reality of the discovery;
but further and more minute observation convinced
him that it was illusory, and that what he,
as well as Debraw had taken for seminal fluid,
was nothing more than light reflected from the
bottoms of the cells, when illuminated by the sun&rsquo;s
rays. Moreover, it did not escape the acute mind
of Huber, that eggs were laid and larv&aelig; hatched,
when there were no drones in existence, viz.
between the months of September and April. The
two hypotheses just mentioned, accounted satisfactorily,
to their supporters, for the prodigious disproportion
in the number of the sexes. But Huber
made the experiment of confining the queen and
rigidly excluding every male from a hive; nay more,
he carefully examined every comb, and satisfied
himself that there was neither male nymph nor
worm present; and lest it should be supposed that
the fertilizing fluid might be imported from other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">- 28 -</a></span>
hives, he totally confined the bees, on two occasions,
and still the eggs were prolific; which
proves clearly that their fertility must have depended
upon the previous impregnation of the
queen. The analogy of wasps is indeed admitted,
by Huish, to discountenance the opinion which he
entertains in common with Maraldi and Debraw.
The queen wasp alone, survives the winter, and
deposits her first eggs in the ensuing spring in
combs of her own construction. Here then impregnation
must have taken place in the preceding
autumn, whilst the eggs were in the ovaria. It
was the opinion of Hattorf, Schirach, and probably
also of Bonner, that the queen-bee impregnated
herself; but this opinion is too extravagant to require
serious refutation: it arose probably, from
their making experiments upon queens taken indiscriminately
from the hives, and which had
previously been impregnated. This no doubt
misled Debraw, who, without knowing it, had
chosen for experiment some queens that had had
commerce with the males. The experiments of
Huber were made upon virgin-queens, with whose
history he was acquainted from the moment of
their leaving their cells. In the course of his
experiments he found that the queens were never
impregnated, so long as they remained in the
interior of the hive; but that <i>impregnation always
takes place in the open air</i>, at a time when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">- 29 -</a></span>
heat has induced the drones to issue from the
hive; on which occasions, the queen soars high in
the air, love being the motive for the only distant
journey she ever takes. &ldquo;The rencontre and
copulation of the queen with the drone take place
exterior to the hive,&rdquo; says Lombard, &ldquo;and whilst
they are on the wing.&rdquo; They are similarly constituted
with the whole family of flies. A corresponding
circumstance may also be noted with
respect to the queen-ant; and Bonnet, in his <i>Contemplations
de la Nature</i>, has observed that <i>she</i> is
always impregnated whilst she is on the wing.
The dragon-flies copulate as they fly through the
air, in which state they have the appearance of a
double animal.</p>

<p>The males and the fertile females, among ants,
are winged insects; the former, as in the case of
drone bees, perish a short time after their amours;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">- 30 -</a></span>
and the females, having alighted upon a spot suitable
for the formation of a colony, cut off their
own wings, as being no longer of any use to them.
(Linn&aelig;us had observed that the females lost their
wings a certain period after impregnation.) A
domino Hunter didici, se bombinatrices sub oculos
in coitu junctos, ut apud muscas mos est, vidisse.
&ldquo;Aculeus,&rdquo; inquit, &ldquo;articulo temporis ejicitur,
et inter gemina insecta, dorso femin&aelig; imponitur.
Hoc situ aliquandiù manent.&rdquo; In the
hornet it is the same.</p>

<p>If the queen-bee be confined, though amid a
seraglio of males, she continues barren. Prior to
her flight, (which is preceded by the flight of the
drones,) she reconnoitres the exterior of the hive,
apparently for the purpose of recognition, and
sometimes, after flying a few feet from it, returns
to it again: finally she rises aloft in the air, describing
in her flight horizontal circles of considerable
diameter, till she is out of sight. She
returns from her aërial excursion in about half
an hour, with the most evident marks of fecundation.
Excursions are sometimes made for a shorter
period, but then she exhibits no sign of having been
impregnated. It is curious that Bonner should have
remarked those aërial excursions, without suspecting
their object. &ldquo;I have often,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;seen
the young queens taking an airing upon the second
or third day of their age.&rdquo; Yet Huish says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">- 31 -</a></span>
&ldquo;It is an acknowledged tact that the queen-bee
never leaves the hive, on any account whatsoever.&rdquo;
Perhaps Huish&rsquo;s observations were made upon
first swarms; and these, according to Huber, are
uniformly conducted by old queens. Swammerdam
also made the same observation as to <i>first
swarms being always led off by old queens</i>. Old
queens have not the same occasion to quit the
hives that young ones have,&mdash;viz. to have intercourse
with the drones; for, according to Huber,
one impregnation is sufficient to fertilize all the
eggs that are laid for two years afterwards, at least.
He <i>thinks</i> it is sufficient to fertilize all that she
lays during her whole life. This may appear, to
some, an incredible period; and Huish inquires,
admitting that a single act of coition be sufficient
to fecundate all the eggs existing in the ovaria at
the time, how those are fecundated which did not
exist there? But when we consider that in the
common spider, according to Audebert, the fertilizing
effect continues for <i>many years</i>; and that
the fecundation of the eggs of the female aphides
or green lice, by the males of one generation, will
continue for a year, passing, during that period,
through <i>nine</i> or <i>ten successive generations</i> of females,
the causes for doubt will, I think, be greatly
diminished: at any rate we are not at liberty to
reject the evidence of facts, because we cannot
understand their <i>modus operandi</i>. With respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">- 32 -</a></span>
to the aphis, Bonnet says the influence of the male
continues through <i>five</i> generations, but Lyonnet
carried his experiments to a more extended period;
and according to Messrs. Kirby and Spence,
who give it &ldquo;upon the authority of Mr. Wolnough
of Hollesley (late of Boyton) in Suffolk, an
intelligent agriculturist, and a most acute and accurate
observer of nature, there may be <i>twenty</i>
generations in a year.&rdquo; Reaumur has proved that
in <i>five</i> generations one aphis may be the progenitor
of 5,904,900,000 descendants. It may be objected
to me here, that the aphis is a viviparous
insect, and that the experiments which prove what
I have referred to, do not therefore bear upon
the question. It has been ascertained, however,
that they are strictly oviparous at the close of the
year (one species is at all times so), at other times
ovo-viviparous; and in either case the penetrating
influence of the male sperm is surely still more
remarkable where there has been no immediate
commerce with the male, than in the direct case
of the oviparous bee! It has been observed, however,
that the further the female aphides are removed
from the first mother, or that which had
known the male, the less prolific do they become.
In order to put my readers in possession of Dr.
Fleming&rsquo;s opinion upon this subject, I will quote
what he has said in his Philosophy of Zoology.
&ldquo;Impregnation, in insects, appears to take place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">- 33 -</a></span>
while the eggs pass a reservoir containing the
sperm, situated near the termination of the oviduct
in the vulva. In dissecting the female parts,
in the silk-moth, says Mr. Hunter, I discovered
a bag, lying on what may be called the vagina or
common oviduct, whose mouth or opening was
external, but it had a canal of communication betwixt
it and the common oviduct. In dissecting
these parts, before copulation, I found this bag
empty; and when I dissected them afterwards, I
found it full. (Phil. Trans. 1792. p. 186.) By
the most decisive experiments, such as covering
the ova of the unimpregnated moth, after exclusion,
with the liquor taken from this bag, in those
which had had sexual intercourse, and rendering
them fertile, he demonstrated that this bag was a
reservoir for the spermatic fluid, to impregnate
the eggs, as they were ready for exclusion, and
that coition and impregnation were not simultaneous.&rdquo;
Linn&aelig;us thought that there was a sexual
intercourse between the queens and the drones,
and he even suspected that it proved fatal to the
latter. His opinion, on both these points, seems
to be confirmed by the experiments of Huber;
who ascertained by repeated observations on
newly impregnated queens, &ldquo;Fuci organum, post
congressum, in corpore femin&aelig; h&aelig;sisse, unde exitus
fatalis expectandus est; ita autem accidere re
verâ non liquet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Apum regina et mater,&rdquo; says Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">- 34 -</a></span>
Kirby, &ldquo;in sublime fertur maritum infelicem petens,
qui voluptatem brevem vitâ emat.&rdquo; Reaumur
thought sexual union necessary to impregnation,
and tried many experiments to ascertain the fact;
such as confining a queen under a glass in company
with drones: and these experiments were
repeated by Huber. Both these naturalists witnessed
the solicitations and advances of the queens
towards the drones, &ldquo;nihilominùs, coeuntia tempore
quovis conspicere non possent.&rdquo; Reaumur <i>fancied</i>
he saw it; there is, however, very great reason to
believe that he was mistaken: the queens so exposed
all proved barren. Swammerdam asserted that
clipping the wings of queens rendered them sterile,
a fact which militates very much against his own
theory of impregnation being produced by a seminal
aura, but strongly confirms the theory of
Huber; as in all probability the mutilating experiments
of Swammerdam were made upon virgin
queens, which thereby lost the power of quitting
the hives. Huber found that clipping the wings
of <i>impregnated</i> queens produced no effect upon
them; it neither diminished the respectful attentions
of the workers, nor interfered with their
laying of eggs. Why impregnation can only take
place in the open air and when the insects are on
the wing, at present remains a mystery.</p>

<p>The young virgin-queens, generally, set out in
quest of the males, the day after they are settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">- 35 -</a></span>
in their new abode, which is usually the fifth day
of their existence as queens, two or three days
being passed in captivity, one in the native hive
after their liberation, and the fifth in the new
dwelling. The ancients seem to have been very
solicitous to establish for the bees a character of
inviolable chastity: Pliny observes, &ldquo;Apium enim
coitus visus nunquam.&rdquo; And Virgil endeavours
to support the same opinion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But of all customs which the bees can boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&rsquo;Tis this that claims our admiration most;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That none will Hymen&rsquo;s softer joys approve,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor waste their spirits in luxurious love:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But all a long virginity maintain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And bring forth young without a mother&rsquo;s pain.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the opinion of most ancient philosophers
that bees derived their origin from the putrid carcases
of animals. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chap. II</a>. Some also have
supposed them to proceed from the parts of fructification
in flowers. Virgil, borrowing as usual
from Aristotle, among the rest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Well might the Bard, on fancy&rsquo;s frolic wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bid, from fresh flowers, enascent myriads spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Raise genial ferment in the slaughter&rsquo;d steer.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And people thence his insect-teeming year;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A fabled race, whom no soft passions move.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The smile of duty nor the glance of love.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;To vindicate, in some measure, the character
of the insect queen, Mr. Wildman boldly dared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">- 36 -</a></span>
to stem the torrent, and revive the long forgotten
idea suggested by Mr. Butler in his <i>Feminine
Monarchy</i>, that queens produce queens only, and
that the common bees are the mothers of common
bees.&rdquo; But all these fanciful notions must yield
to the clear and decisive experiments of Huber,
who has satisfactorily shown that <i>the queen is the
general mother of all</i>; he has also resolved the
causes of former mistaken opinions. Many apiarians
have found a difficulty in admitting the
theory of Huber, in consequence of the very great
disproportion in the number of the sexes, there
being only one female to several hundred males,
and one impregnation being, in his opinion, all
that is required to fertilize myriads of eggs. The
number of drones may be considered as in accordance,
in some degree, with the general profusion
of nature: we find her abounding with
supernumeraries in a great variety of instances, in
the blossoms of trees and flowers, as well as in the
relative number of one sex to the other among
animals. Huber conceives that it was necessary
there should be a great number of drones, that
the queen might be sure of finding one, in her excursion
through the expanse of the atmosphere,
and run no risk of sterility.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a> I have stated the opinion of Mr.
Dobbs, that a queen has intercourse with several
drones; and what I have also stated upon the authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">- 37 -</a></span>
of Mr. Hunter, in <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>, with respect
to the silk-moth and other insects, gives countenance
to that opinion: nor do I see its inconsistency
with the discovery made by Huber. Though
there is reason to believe that the act proves fatal
to one devoted drone, yet those that are so fortunate
as to obtain the first favours of her majesty,
may escape uninjured. If the conjecture which I
have thus hazarded be correct, it will appear less
surprising that so many drones should be brought
into existence.</p>

<p>The queen begins to lay her eggs as soon as a
few portions of comb are completely formed. By
the time that combs five or six inches square are
constructed, eggs, honey and bee-bread will be
found in them. Huber states that <i>the laying
usually commences forty-six hours after the intercourse
with the male; and that during the eleven
succeeding months, the eggs of workers only are
laid; after which a considerable and uninterrupted
laying of drones&rsquo; eggs commences</i>. This period may
be retarded by the temperature of the atmosphere.
Huber relates an instance where, the weather having
become suddenly cold, after an impregnation
which took place on the 31st of October, that
queen did not lay till the March following. The
effects of retardation will be noticed presently.
<i>Twenty days after the queen has begun to lay the
eggs of drones, &ldquo;the working bees,&rdquo;</i> says Huber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">- 38 -</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>construct the</i> <span class="smcap">royal cells</span>, <i>in which the queens,
without discontinuing the laying of male eggs, deposit,
at the interval of one, two or three days, those
eggs from which the queens are successively to
spring</i>.&rdquo; This laying of the eggs of drones, which
is called the great laying, usually happens in May.
There seems to be a secret relation between the
production of these eggs, and the construction of
royal cells: the laying commonly lasts thirty days,
and regularly on the 20th or 21st day, as has been
already observed, royal cells are founded. <i>When
the larv&aelig;, hatched from the eggs laid by the queen
in the royal cells, are ready to be transformed to
nymphs, this queen leaves the hive, conducting a
swarm along with her.</i> A swarm is always led off
by a single queen; and Huber remarks that it was
necessary for instinct to impel the old queen to
lead forth the first swarm; for, being the strongest,
she would never fail to overthrow the younger
competitors for the throne, near which &ldquo;the jealous
Semiramis of the hive will bear no rival.&rdquo;
The queen, having finished her laying of male
eggs and of royal eggs, prior to her quitting the
old hive, is ready to commence, in the new one,
with the laying of workers&rsquo; eggs, workers being
first needed, in order to secure the continuance
and prosperity of the newly founded commonwealth.
The bees that remain in the old hive
take particular care of the royal cells, and prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">- 39 -</a></span>
the young queens, successively hatched, from
leaving them, except at an interval of several days
from each departure. But I have already adverted
to their mode of proceeding on these occasions.
<i>Vide</i> <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>. <i>The law of primogeniture</i> is always
strictly observed towards these royal insects, the
first-born or princess-royal being always selected to
go off with the second swarm, or to reign over
the parent stock, as the case may be; and so on
with respect to the third and fourth, or whatever
number may issue. It is remarkable that a queen
seldom, if ever, leads forth a swarm, except there
be sunshine and calm air. Such a ferment occasionally
rages in the hives, as soon as the young
queens are hatched, that Huber has often observed
the thermometer placed in the hive, rise suddenly
from about 92&deg; to above 104&deg; Fahrenheit. This
suffocating heat he considers as one of the means
employed by nature for urging the bees to go off
in swarms. <i>In warm weather one strong hive has
been known to send off four swarms in 18 days.</i>
<i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Chap. XIII</a>.</p>

<p>According to Huber, <i>the queen ordinarily lays
about 12,000 eggs in two months</i>, one impregnation
serving, as has been before stated, for the whole
complement of eggs, of every description, which
she lays during two years at least. It is not to
be supposed that she lays at the rate of 12,000
eggs every two months, but she does so at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">- 40 -</a></span>
principal laying in April and May: there is also
another great laying in August. Early in November
the laying usually ceases. Reaumur states
the number of eggs laid by a queen in two months
at double the amount of Huber&rsquo;s calculation; viz.
200 a day, on an average. This variation may
have arisen from variety of climate, season, or
other circumstances. <i>A moderate swarm has been
calculated to consist of from 12,000 to 20,000</i>,
which is about a two months&rsquo; laying. Schirach
says that <i>a single queen will lay from 70,000 to
100,000 eggs in a season</i>. This sounds like
a great number; but it is greatly exceeded by
some other insects. The female of the white
ant extrudes not less than 60 eggs in a minute,
which gives 3600 in an hour, 86,400 in a day,
2,419,200 in a lunar month, and the enormous
number of 211,449,600 in a year. Though she
does not lay all the year probably, yet, setting the
period as low as possible, her eggs will exceed
the number produced by any other known animal
in creation.</p>

<p>If the <i>impregnation</i> of a queen be by any means
<i>retarded</i> beyond the 20th or 21st day of her life,
a very extraordinary consequence ensues. Instead
of first laying the eggs of workers, and those of
drones, at the usual period afterwards, she begins
from the 45th hour to lay the latter, and lays no
other kind during her whole life. It should seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">- 41 -</a></span>
as if the rudiments of the workers&rsquo; eggs withered
in the oviducts, but without obstructing the passage
of the drones&rsquo; eggs. The only known fact
analogous to this is the state of certain vegetable
seeds, which lose the faculty of germination from
age, whatever care may have been taken to preserve
them. This retardation seems to have a
singular effect upon the whole animal &#339;conomy of
the queen. &ldquo;The bodies of those queens,&rdquo; says
Huber, &ldquo;whose impregnation has been retarded,
are shorter than common; the extremities remain
slender, whilst the first two rings, next the thorax,
are uncommonly swollen.&rdquo; In consequence of the
shortening of their bodies, their eggs are frequently
laid on the sides of the cells, owing probably
to their not being able to reach the bottom;
the difficulty is also increased by the two swollen
rings. In these cases of retarded impregnation
and exclusive laying of drones&rsquo; eggs, the prosperity
of the hive soon terminates; generally before
the end of the queen&rsquo;s laying. The workers receiving
no addition to their number, but on the
contrary, finding themselves overwhelmed with
drones, sacrifice their queen and abandon the hive.
These retarded queens seem to have their instincts
impaired; for they deposit their eggs indiscriminately
in the cells, whether originally intended for
drones or for workers,&mdash;a circumstance which materially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">- 42 -</a></span>
affects the size of the drones that are
reared in them. There are not wanting instances
of royal cells being occupied by them, and of the
workers being thereby so completely deceived as
to pay the tenants, in all respects, the honours of
royalty. This circumstance appears the more extraordinary,
since it has been ascertained that
when eggs have been thus inappropriately deposited,
by fertile workers, they are uniformly destroyed
a few days afterwards, though for a short
time they receive due attention.</p>

<p>The workers have been supposed by some apiarians
to transport the eggs from place to place;&mdash;if
ever such were the case, this would seem to be
an occasion calling for the practice: on the contrary,
instead of removing the eggs from the sides
to the bottoms of the cells, for the sake of better
accommodation, this object is accomplished by their
lengthening the cells, and advancing them two
lines beyond the surface of the combs. This proceeding
affords pretty good evidence that <i>the
transportation of eggs</i> forms no part of the workers&rsquo;
occupation. It is still further proved by their
eating any workers&rsquo; eggs, that a queen may, at any
time, be forced to deposit in drones&rsquo; cells, or drop
at random in other parts of the hive; a circumstance
which escaped the notice of former naturalists,
and misled them in their opinion respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">- 43 -</a></span>
transportation. A somewhat similar circumstance
was noticed by Mr. Dunbar in his mirror
hive. (For an account of this hive see <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chap. X.</a>)
Mr. Dunbar observed that whenever the queen
dropped her eggs carelessly, they were eagerly
devoured by the workers. Now if transportation
formed a part of their employment, they
would in these cases, instead of eating the eggs,
have deposited them in their appropriate cells. It
seems very evident therefore that the proper disposition
of the eggs is left entirely to the instinct
of the queens. The workers having been seen to
run away with the eggs, in order to devour them,
in all probability gave birth to the mistaken notion
that they were removing them to their right cells.
Among humble-bees, there is a disposition, among
the workers, to eat the eggs, which extends even
to those that are laid in proper cells, where the
queens often have to contend for their preservation.</p>

<p>After the season of swarming, viz. towards the
end of July, as is well known, a general <i>massacre
of the drones</i> takes place. The business of fecundation
being now completed, they are regarded
as useless consumers of the fruits of others labour,
&ldquo;fruges consumere nati;&rdquo; love is at once converted
into furious hate, and a general proscription
takes place. The unfortunate victims evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">- 44 -</a></span>
perceive their danger; for they are never, at this
time, seen resting in one place, but darting in or
out of the hive, with the utmost precipitation, as
if in fear of being seized. Their destruction has
been generally supposed to be effected by the
workers harassing them till they quit the hive:
this was the opinion of Mr. Hunter, who says the
workers pinch them to and fro, without stinging
them, and he considers their death as a natural
rather than an untimely one. In this Bonnet seems
to agree with Mr. Hunter. But Huber has observed
that <i>their destruction is effected by the stings
of the workers:</i> he ascertained this by placing his
hives upon a glass table, as will be stated under
the anatomy of the bee, article &ldquo;Sting.&rdquo; Reaumur
seems to have been aware of this, for he has remarked
that &ldquo;notwithstanding the superiority
which the drones seem to have from their bulk,
they cannot hold out against the workers, who are
armed with a poniard which conveys poison into
the wounds it makes.&rdquo; The moment this formidable
weapon has entered their bodies, they expand
their wings and expire. This sacrifice is not the
consequence of a blind indiscriminating instinct,
for <i>if a hive be deprived of its queen, no massacre
takes place</i>, though the hottest persecution rage
in all the surrounding hives. This fact was observed
by Bonner, who supposed the drones to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">- 45 -</a></span>
preserved for the sake of the additional heat which
they would generate in the hive during winter;
but according to Huber&rsquo;s theory, they are preserved
for the purpose of impregnating a new
queen. The lives of the drones are also spared
in hives which possess fertile workers only, but
no proper queen, and likewise in hives governed
by a queen whose impregnation has been retarded;
but under any other circumstances the drones
all disappear before winter. Not only all that
have undergone their full transformations, but
every embryo, in whatever period of its existence,
shares the same fate. The workers drag them
forth from the cells, and after sucking the fluid
from their bodies, cast them out of the hive. In
all these respects the hive-bees resemble wasps,
but with this difference; among the latter, not
only are the males and the male larv&aelig; destroyed,
but all the workers and their larv&aelig;, (and the very
combs themselves,) are involved in one indiscriminate
ruin, none remaining alive during the winter
but the queens, which lie dormant in various holes
and corners till the ensuing spring,&mdash;of course
without food, for they store none. The importance
of destroying these mother wasps in the
spring will be noticed in another place.</p>

<p>Morier in his second journey through Persia
(page 100) has recorded a fact, which, though it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">- 46 -</a></span>
did not come under his own immediate observation,
was related to him by a person on whose authority
he could place full reliance, and which is
directly the reverse of what I have stated respecting
bees. It is, that among the locusts, when the
female has done laying, she is surrounded and
killed by the males.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">THE APIARY.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> first object of consideration, in the establishment
of an apiary, is situation.</p>

<p>The aspect has, in general, been regarded as of
prime importance, but I think there are other
points of still greater importance.</p>

<p>An apiary would not be well situated near a
great river, nor in the neighbourhood of the
sea, as windy weather might whirl the bees into
the water and destroy them.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the ancients that bees, in
windy weather, carried weights, to prevent them
from being whiffled about, in their progress
through the air: Virgil has observed that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They with light pebbles, like a balanc&rsquo;d boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pois&rsquo;d, through the air on even pinions float.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Sotheby&rsquo;s Georgics.</span></p></div>

<p>This assertion, which was probably borrowed
by the poet from his predecessor Aristotle, and
which has since been repeated by Pliny, is now
ascertained to be erroneous. The error has been
noticed by both Swammerdam and Reaumur, and
ascribed by them to preceding observers having
mistaken the mason bee for a hive-bee. The former
builds its nest against a wall, with a composition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">- 48 -</a></span>
of gravel, sand and its own saliva, and when
freighted with the former article, may easily have
led a careless observer into the erroneous opinion
above alluded to.</p>

<p>From a similar inaccuracy of observation, it is
probable that flies were confounded with bees by
ancient naturalists, and that from thence arose
the absurd notion, of the latter being generated
in putrid carcases, as we know the former
to be; and this error was most likely confirmed
by their having found both honey and bees in the
carcases of dead animals, as recorded in the case
of Samson.</p>

<p>Though, for the reasons above stated, an apiary
would not be well situated near a large river, yet
it should not be far from a rivulet or spring:
small ones, that glide gently over pebbles, are the
most desirable, as affording a variety of resting
places for the bees to alight upon. If neither
spring nor streamlet be near, a broad dish of
water should be placed for the bees, the bottom
being covered with small stones or duckweed, to
facilitate their drinking and prevent drowning.</p>

<p>This, in a hot dry season, is of considerable
importance, as it will save that time, which must
otherwise be spent, in fetching water from a distance;
for without water, as will be noticed hereafter,
no wax can be formed.</p>

<p>It is of course of the greatest importance that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">- 49 -</a></span>
the apiary be situated near to good pasturage,
such as clover, saintfoin, buckwheat, &amp;c.&mdash;better
still if in a garden well stocked with suitable
plants.</p>

<p>It should be near the residence of the proprietor,
as well for the purpose of rendering the bees
tractable and well acquainted with the family, as
for affording a good view of their general proceedings;
if it be so situated that its front may form
a right angle with the window of the family sitting-room,
an easy opportunity will be afforded
to watch the bustle of swarming.</p>

<p>An out-door apiary should admit of being approached
at the back part, to give an opportunity
of making observations on the proceedings of the
bees, or to perform any requisite operation upon
them.</p>

<p>The hives should be placed upon separate
stands, supported by single posts or pedestals, be
raised from sixteen inches to two feet above the
ground, and be three or four feet from each other;
and they should stand quite clear of any wall or
fence.</p>

<p>The resting-boards should project several
inches in front of the hives, that the bees may
have plenty of room to alight, when they return
home loaded from the fields, and should be screwed
down firmly to the tops of the stands, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">- 50 -</a></span>
hives may not be overturned by high winds or
other accidents.</p>

<p>They should be free from the droppings of
trees, from noisome smells and disagreeable
noises; and be guarded as much as possible from
the extremes of heat and cold.</p>

<p>Most apiarians are agreed that the aspect of
the apiary should, in this country, be more or less
southerly, and that it should be well secured from
the north and south-west, by trees, high hedges,
or other fences; this is the opinion of Wildman,
Keys, and Huish; Bonner, however, prefers an
easterly aspect; Huish recommends two points
to the east and one to the south. Wildman preferred
a south-west aspect, as not tempting the
labourers to emerge too early, and as affording a
later light for their return home in the evening.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Skreen&rsquo;d from the east; where no delusive dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Chills, while it tempts them o&rsquo;er the dew damp lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, as on loaded wing, the labourers roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sol&rsquo;s last bright glories light them to their home.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>Milton says: &ldquo;It is not material in what aspect
the stock stands, provided the sun shines on the
hive once in the course of the day, for that well-peopled
hives, kept dry, will thrive in most situations.&rdquo;
And provided due attention be paid to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">- 51 -</a></span>
other circumstances calculated to promote their
prosperity, I coincide in opinion with Milton.</p>

<p>Some recommend a valley or hollow glen, for
the convenience of the bees returning home with
their loads. At any rate care should be taken
that no walls, trees, houses, nor anything else,
impede the issuing forth of the bees to their pasturage,
nor obstruct their return in right lines to
the hives. They should be able to fly off from
the resting-boards at an angle of about forty degrees
with the plane of the horizon.</p>

<p>To those who, residing in towns, may consider
it as indispensable to the success of an apiary,
that it should be in the <i>immediate</i> vicinity of
good pasturage, and be thereby deterred from
benefiting and amusing themselves by keeping
bees; it may be satisfactory to learn, that the
apiary of the celebrated Bonner was situated in a
garret, in the centre of Glasgow, where it flourished
for several years, and furnished him with
the means of making many interesting and valuable
observations, which he gave to the world
about thirty years ago.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">THE BEE-HOUSE.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">N</span>o</span> one that could afford to purchase bee-boxes,
and to construct a bee-house, or to convert to that
use some building already constructed, would
hesitate, I should think, to give them the preference
over common straw-hives and an out-door
apiary, whether he looked to ultimate profit
or to present convenience and security.</p>

<p>Perhaps I cannot give a better notion of what
I consider as the most eligible plan of a bee-house,
than by describing the construction of my
own. The whole building, besides answering the
purpose of an apiary, may be made subservient to
other uses;&mdash;my own serves for storing potatoes.
The potatoe-cellar is sunk two thirds of its depth
in the earth, and the bee-house is raised upon it,
having a couple of steps up to the door. The dimensions
of both are seven feet six inches by six
feet clear within, which affords room for five colonies.</p>

<p>The piles or stories of bee-boxes are placed in
the bee-house at somewhat less than two feet
apart, so as to make the external entrance to each
pile respectively, about a yard asunder.&mdash;See the
plate which forms the frontispiece of this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">- 53 -</a></span></p>

<p>On the inside of the bee-house, the boxes in
the upper row stand about table height, those in
the lower row, about six inches above the floor.
On the outside, the entrances to the upper row
are about five feet, the entrances to the lower row
about three feet from the ground. The entrances
through the wall may be cut in stone, bricks or
wood, and should be chamfered away on the outside,
leaving the wall at those parts as thin as
practicable, and letting the opening correspond in
size with the outlets that are sunk in the floor
boards to be hereafter described. The potatoe-cellar
is built with bricks, the bee-house of timber,
lathed and plastered within, and thatched on the
outside.</p>

<p>Where the bees enter the boxes, two wooden
shelves or resting-boards are fixed, two or three
inches thick, to prevent warping; they extend the
whole length of the building, are about a foot
wide, and rest on cross pieces, nailed fast to the
uprights with which the bee-house is built: these
cross pieces extend also about fifteen inches into
the bee-house, where they serve as supporters for
the shelves on which the bee-boxes are placed.
The resting-boards on the outside are divided, by
bricks on the edge, into several compartments, as
shown in the frontispiece; the bricks extend
the full width of the resting board, and all the
compartments are slated over. By this means the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">- 54 -</a></span>
entrances are well sheltered, and accommodation
is afforded for the bees, when they are at any time
driven home, by stress of weather, in greater
numbers than can readily pass through the entrances
into the boxes; for on the approach of a
storm, the bees will sometimes return home from
the fields, in such numbers and with such precipitation,
as almost to block up the entrances into
the hives.</p>

<p>The building is not only thatched on the top,
but down the sides and ends, as low as the potatoe-cellar.
On that side where the bees enter the
boxes, the thatch of course terminates at the top
of the compartments, over which it is spread out
so as to conceal the slate coverings. The floor
of the bee-house is boarded and the potatoe-cellar
is ceiled, the space between the ceiling and the
floor above being filled with dry sawdust. The
door may be situated where most convenient; but
the window or windows should be at one end or at
both ends, that the light may fall sideways on the
bee-boxes, and should be made to open, as in case
of any of the bees accidentally getting into the
bee-house, they may be let out more conveniently.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have an extra entrance, or
rather an extra outlet, for discharging the bees
when the time of deprivation arrives, which will
be hereafter explained. My own outlet is placed
in a line with and between the lower tier of boxes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">PASTURAGE.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">I</span>t</span> is of the first importance to the success of an
apiary, that it should be in a neighbourhood
where the bees can be supplied with an abundance
of good pasturage, as upon that will depend the
fecundity of the queen and the harvest of wax and
honey.</p>

<p>If <i>Dutch clover</i> (<i>Trifolium repens</i>) be neither
grown abundantly by the neighbouring farmers, nor
the spontaneous growth of the surrounding country,
the apiarian should, if possible, crop some ground
with it himself, as it is one of the grand sources
from which bees collect their honey in the spring,
and indeed during a considerable portion of the
principal gathering season. From the value of
clover in this respect, one species of it (<i>Trifolium
pratense</i>) has acquired the name of Honey-suckle
clover. <i>Yellow trefoil</i> also (<i>Medicago lupulina</i>),
though not so great a favourite with the bees as
Dutch clover, is nevertheless a valuable pasturage
for them, in consequence of its blossoming earlier
than the clover.</p>

<p>Though I have made Dutch clover take precedence
of every other bee pasturage,&mdash;a precedence
which in this country at least it is fairly entitled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">- 56 -</a></span>
to,&mdash;yet it is by no means the first in the order
of the seasons.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;First the gray willow&rsquo;s glossy pearls they steal.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or rob the hazel of its golden meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the gay crocus and the violet blue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yield to the flexile trunk ambrosial dew.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The earliest resources of the bee are <i>the willow,
the hazel, the osier, the poplar, the sycamore</i> and
<i>the plane</i>, all which are very important adjuncts to
the neighbourhood of an apiary. The catkins of
several of them afford an abundant supply of
farina, and attract the bees very strongly in early
spring when the weather is fine. Mr. Kirby, in
his <i>Monographia Apum Angli&aelig;</i>, considers the
<i>female</i> catkins of the different species of Salix as
affording honey, the <i>male</i> ones, pollen.</p>

<p>To these may be added <i>the snowdrop, the crocus,
white alyssum, laurustinus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Orange</i> and <i>lemon trees</i> also, and other <i>green-house
plants</i>, afford excellent honey, and might be
advantageously presented to the bees at this
season.</p>

<p><i>Gooseberry, currant</i> and <i>raspberry trees</i> likewise,
with <i>sweet marjoram, winter savory</i> and <i>peppermint</i>,
should not be far off them. From the early
blossoming of the two first, and from their
yielding an extraordinary quantity of honey, they
form some of the first sources of spring food for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">- 57 -</a></span>
the bees, and in all probability furnish them with
the pale green pellets, then seen upon their thighs.</p>

<p><i>The peach, nectarine</i>, &amp;c. are also valuable, on
account of their blossoming very early.</p>

<p><i>Apple</i> and <i>pear trees</i>, which in Worcestershire
and Herefordshire, during several weeks of spring,
seem to form</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;One boundless blush, one white empurpled shower<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of mingled blossoms,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p0">and give those counties the appearance of a perfect
paradise, &ldquo;may be said to constitute a second
course for the bees, after their earlier spring feast
on the bloom of the currants, gooseberries, and all
the varieties of wall fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Alder buds</i> and <i>flowers</i> are also particularly
grateful to bees; the former are said to afford
honey for six months together. The maple and
the lime also afford it for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Dickson, in his &ldquo;Agriculture,&rdquo; states that the
blossoms of <i>the bean</i>, which are highly fragrant,
though affording but a scanty supply of honey,
are nevertheless frequented by crowds of bees.
&ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; says Dr. Evans, &ldquo;an instance of mistaken
instinct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young spotted leaves of <i>the vetch</i> (<i>Anthyllis
vulneraria</i>) they likewise ply continually for three
months together, as well as its flowers, even though
very distant from their homes. The beans also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">- 58 -</a></span>
which prove most attractive to them are those
with spotted leaves.</p>

<p>From the partiality of these natural chemists
for the spotted leaves of the vetch and bean, I
suspect that the spotting originates from disease,
which causes those leaves to throw out a honeyed
secretion. In this opinion I am strengthened by
what Mr. Hubbard has stated, in a paper presented
to the Society of Arts for 1799, respecting
papilionaceous plants. &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;from
the flower, but a small leaf, with a black spot on
it, which, in warm weather, keeps constantly
oozing, that the bees gather their honey.&rdquo; Mr.
Hubbard also assures us in the same paper that
<i>the tare</i> (<i>Ervum hirsutum</i> et <i>tetraspermum</i>) is
highly useful to bees; and that several acres, sown
near his apiary, otherwise badly situated, rendered
it very productive.</p>

<p><i>Turnips, mustard</i>, and all <i>the cabbage tribe</i> are
also important auxiliaries; their culture is strongly
recommended by Wildman, as affording spring food
to the bees. In the autumn a field of <i>buckwheat</i> becomes
a very valuable resource for them, from its
prolonged succession of bloom. Buckwheat flowers
in bunches, which contain ripe seeds in one part,
while blossoms are but just opening in another.
Huber has given his testimony in favour of this
black grain, and Worlidge says that he has known
the bees of a very large apiary fill the combs with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">- 59 -</a></span>
honey in a fortnight, in consequence of being
placed near a large field of buckwheat. Bees
indeed like to have every thing upon a large scale;
whole fields of clover, beans, the brassica tribe
and buckwheat, as has been just observed, attracting
them much more strongly than scattered
plants, though affording finer honey, such as
creeping lemon thyme, mignonette, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some flowers they pass by, though yielding a
considerable quantity of honey: those of the honey-suckle
for instance, though much frequented by
the humble-bee, are never visited by the hive-bee,
the superior length of the proboscis of the former
enabling it to collect what is quite out of the reach
of the latter. Every flower of the trumpet honey-suckle
(<i>Lonicera sempervirens</i>), if separated from
the germen, after it is open, will yield two or
three drops of pure nectar.</p>

<p>In the Transactions of the Society of Arts for
1789, Mr. John. Lane speaks of the fondness of
bees for <i>leek blossoms</i>, and says that he raised
leeks extensively for their use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bees will rejoice,&rdquo; says Mr. Isaac, &ldquo;when
they see the neighbourhood variegated by the
blossoms of <i>sunflowers, hollyhocks</i> and <i>Spanish
broom</i>, and even the <i>dandelion</i>, which embellishes
the garden of the sluggard.&rdquo; Dr. Evans observed
that bees not only collect farina from the numerous
assemblage of anthers in the flower of the hollyhock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">- 60 -</a></span>
but a balsamic varnish also, (most likely
propolis,) from the young blossom buds, and says
he has seen a bee rest upon the same bud for ten
minutes at least, moulding the balsam with its fore-feet
and transferring it to the hinder legs. An
elegant modern writer, speaking of the fondness
of bees in general for the flowers of the hollyhock,
observes that &ldquo;it has been held a gross libel upon
animals to say, that a man has made a beast of
himself, when he has drunk to such excess as to
lose his reason; but we might without injustice
say, that he has made a humble-bee of himself,
for those little debauchees are particularly prone
to intoxication. Round the nectaries of hollyhocks,
you may generally observe a set of determined
topers quaffing as pertinaciously as if they
belonged to Wilkes&rsquo;s club; and round about the
flower, (to follow up the simile,) several of the
bon-vivants will be found lying on the ground
inebriated and insensible.&rdquo; I have frequently
seen the ground beneath one of my pear-trees
strewed over with hive-bees and wasps, in a
similar state, after they had banqueted upon the
rich juices of the fallen fruit. Mr. Kirby, in his
<i>Monographia Apum Angli&aelig;</i>, observes that the
male humble-bees, when the thistles are in bloom,
are often seen asleep or torpid upon its flowers,
and sometimes acting as if intoxicated with the
sweets they have been imbibing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">- 61 -</a></span></p>

<p><i>The holly, the privet, phillyrea, elder</i> and <i>common
bramble</i>, together with <i>sweet fennel, nasturtiums</i>
and <i>asparagus</i>, are also much frequented by
the bees. They are likewise very partial to the
yellow flowers of the <i>crowfoot</i>, as well as to the
flowers of <i>the dead nettle</i>, especially the white.</p>

<p>The blossoms of <i>the cucumber, gourd</i> and <i>vegetable
marrow</i> also, yield a considerable quantity
both of honey and farina, as do likewise those of
the <i>white lily</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></p></div>

<p>Dr. Evans speaks of the <i>Cacalia</i> or <i>Alpine
coltsfoot</i> as affording a great quantity of honey,
the scent of which is often diffused to a considerable
distance; and Dr. Darwin, in a note to his
&ldquo;Botanic Garden,&rdquo; mentions having counted on
one of those plants, besides bees of various kinds,
upwards of two hundred painted butterflies, which
gave it the appearance of being loaded with
additional flowers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When o&rsquo;er her nectar&rsquo;d couch papilios crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And bees in clusters hum their plaudits loud.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; says the anonymous writer whom
I lately quoted, &ldquo;that brings the bees buzzing
round us so busily? See, it is this tuft of coltsfoot,
which they approach with a harmonious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">- 62 -</a></span>
chorus, somewhat like the <i>Non nobis, Domine</i>, of
our singers; and after partaking silently of the luxurious
banquet, again setup their tuneful P&aelig;ans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ornamental flowers, such as roses, ranunculuses,
anemones, pinks and carnations, afford little or no
pabulum for bees, and tulips are probably pernicious
to them, dead bees being frequently found
in their flowers.</p>

<p>It would be a great acquisition to the bees to
have near them a large plantation of <i>borage</i>, which
affords peculiarly delicate honey, as does also
<i>viper&rsquo;s bugloss</i>. The former continues blooming
for many months, and, bearing a pendant flower,
it is not liable to be washed by rain; <i>mignonette</i>
too, if sown abundantly, is a plant of considerable
importance to the apiary, and for a somewhat
similar reason,&mdash;its continuing in bloom till the
autumnal frosts set in, and its yielding honey of
peculiar whiteness and delicacy. Instances have
been known, of an abundant crop of these two
flowers affording a large supply of honey to the
apiary, near which they were sown, when, at the
same time, there was a general failure of all the
neighbouring stocks.</p>

<p><i>Lemon thyme</i> should be planted in every bee-garden,
wherever room can be afforded for it: it
blossoms late, (the beginning of August,) and
affords very fine flavoured honey. It might be
advantageously used as an edging for garden walks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">- 63 -</a></span>
and flower-beds, instead of box; some use thrift
and daisies for the same purpose. Box has the
character of giving honey a bitter flavour, and
Pliny has observed that the Romans, in laying
tribute upon Corsica, exacted from the inhabitants
two hundred pounds of wax, but wholly excepted
honey, on account of its being flavoured by the
box-tree.</p>

<p><i>The common teasel</i> (<i>Dipsacus sylvestris</i>) should
have a place near every bee-house, as it not only
supplies honey from its rich purple heads, but
yields a seasonable supply of water, in the cups
formed by the leaves at every joint of the stem,
which contain from a spoonful to half a pint of
water. This convenience is still more efficiently
supplied by the large floating leaves of <i>the water
lily</i>, which should if practicable be introduced
near every apiary. As should also the great hairy
<i>willow-herb</i> (<i>Epilobium hirsutum</i>), a very ornamental
though a very common plant, growing by the
sides of rivulets.</p>

<p><i>Furze, broom, heath</i> and <i>saintfoin</i>, are good
neighbours to an apiary. The blossoms of furze
so abound with honey as to be pervaded strongly
by the scent of it, and the broom has been extolled
ever since the days of Pliny. Mr. Bradley speaks
in the highest terms of its blossoms, as affording
a great quantity of honey; but he greatly prefers
the Spanish broom, and says that an acre of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">- 64 -</a></span>
would maintain ten stocks. The culture of saintfoin
as a bee-pasture is also well worthy of the
apiarian&rsquo;s attention in some situations; for though
it flourishes best in a calcareous soil, it will thrive
in soils which are too poor either for grass or tillage.
Furze and broom are particularly serviceable
on account of their blossoming early and
long, and abounding in farina.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the lateness of its bloom
makes <i>ivy</i> a very valuable resource for the bees.
On a fine day at the end of October, among the
ivy-mantled towers of an old castle, I have heard
their humming noise, so loud as scarcely to be
exceeded by that which they make, among the
trees affected with honey-dew, in summer. I
should however conceive that the ivy blossom is
principally serviceable as affording pollen, which
the bees probably warehouse, for feeding the
young larv&aelig; in the ensuing spring. Mr. Hunter
recommends St. John&rsquo;s wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>),
which also comes in late, as a favourite
plant for collecting pollen, for winter&rsquo;s store. This
stored pollen is used for feeding the earliest
hatched larv&aelig;, though it is evident that the bees
prefer fresh for the purpose, from their collecting
it as early in the spring as possible, and from the
quantity of stored pollen that is found in every
old hive.</p>

<p><i>Commons surrounded by woods</i> are well known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">- 65 -</a></span>
to make an apiary productive, the commons
abounding with wild thyme and various other
flowers, which the scythe never touches; and the
trees, in addition to their farina, affording in some
seasons a profusion of honey-dew. The forwardness
and activity of hives thus situated, may, in
part, be attributed to the sheltering protection of
the woods.</p>

<p>Keys says he never observed bees to be particularly
fond of the wild thyme. In this he is
opposed to almost all the authors who have
written upon the subject. Theophrastus, Pliny,
Varro, Columella, and various other writers, speak
in the highest terms of it. The Abbé Barthelemy
speaks thus of bees. &ldquo;These insects are extremely
partial to Mount Hymettus, which they
have filled with their colonies, and which is covered
almost every where with wild thyme and other
odoriferous plants; but it is chiefly from the
excellent thyme the Mount produces, that they
extract those precious sweets, with which they
compose a honey in high estimation throughout
Greece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That flowers impart a portion of their flavour
to honey, seems to be generally admitted, though
probably not so much as some have imagined. It
is not to be supposed that the bee confines itself,
in this country at least, to a few particular
flowers,&mdash;it ranges through a great variety; excellent
honey has been produced where the bees
had little access to any flowers but those of nettles
and other weeds.</p>

<p>Still however the balm of Pontus, the thyme of
Hymettus, and the rosemary of Narbonne, are generally
supposed, from their aromatic flowers, to
give its peculiar excellence to the celebrated
honey of those places.</p>

<p>It should seem therefore that <i>rosemary</i> might
prove of importance in the neighbourhood of an
apiary, by improving the quality and increasing
the quantity of honey in certain seasons, viz.
if the weather were very hot and dry, when it
blossomed; for it never affords much honey in
this country, excepting in such a season. It blossoms
the earliest of aromatic herbs, and should
of course be planted in a southern aspect.</p>

<p>Having said thus much upon the power which
flowers possess of imparting a peculiar flavour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">- 67 -</a></span>
the honey which is extracted from them, I will
now advert to what has been stated relative to
their impregnating it with deleterious qualities.
During the celebrated retreat of the ten thousand,
as recorded by Xenophon in his <i>Memorabilia</i>, the
soldiers sucked some honey-combs in a place near
Trebizonde, where was a great number of bee-hives,
and in consequence became intoxicated,
and were attacked with vomiting and purging.
He states that they did not recover their senses
for twenty-four hours, nor their strength for three
or four days. Tournefort, when travelling in Asia,
bearing in mind this account of Xenophon, was very
diligent in his endeavours to ascertain its truth,
and had good reason to be satisfied respecting it.
He concluded that the honey had been extracted
from a shrub growing in the neighbourhood of
Trebizonde, which is well known to produce the
before-mentioned effects, and even to disturb the
head by its odour. From his description and
that of others, the plant from which this honey
was extracted, appears to be the <i>Rhododendron
ponticum</i> or <i>Azalea pontica</i> of Linn&aelig;us, both nearly
allied to each other, and growing abundantly in
that part of the country. The smell resembles
honey-suckle, but is much stronger. Father Lamberti
confirms Xenophon&rsquo;s account, by stating
similar effects to have been produced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">- 68 -</a></span>
honey of Colchis or Mingrelia, where this shrub
is also common.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin, in his &ldquo;Temple of Nature,&rdquo; states
that some plants afford a honey which is intoxicating
and poisonous to man, and that what is
afforded by others is so injurious to the bees themselves,
that sometimes they will not collect it.
And Dr. Barton, in the American Philosophical
Transactions, has stated that, in the autumn and
winter of 1790, the honey collected near Philadelphia
proved fatal to many, in consequence of
which, a minute inquiry was instituted under the
direction of the American Government, when it
was ascertained satisfactorily, that the fatal honey
had been chiefly extracted from the flowers of the
<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>. Still more recently, two persons
at New York are said to have lost their lives by
eating wild honey, which was supposed to have
been gathered from the flowers of the dwarf laurel,
a thriving shrub in the American woods. I shall
resume this subject in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIV">Chap. 24</a>, on Bee-maladies.</p>

<p>It appears also that at the time of the inquiry
set on foot by the American Government, similar
fatal consequences were produced among those
who had eaten the common American pheasant,
which, on examination, was found to arise from
the pheasants having fed upon the leaves of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">- 69 -</a></span>
same plant <i>Kalmia latifolia</i>. This led to a public
proclamation prohibiting the use of the pheasant
for food during that season.</p>

<p>As most of the plants here enumerated are
now introduced into our gardens, they might be
supposed to injure the British honey. Most probably,
however, their proportion to the whole of
the flowers in bloom is too small to produce any
such inconvenience; whereas on their native continent
they exclusively cover whole tracts of
country.</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter on Bee-Pasturage,
without adverting to what Linn&aelig;us has said of
the <i>Fritillaria imperialis</i> or <i>crown imperial</i>, and of
the <i>Melianthus</i> or <i>honey-flower</i>. Of the former,
he observes that &ldquo;no plant, melianthus alone excepted,
abounds so much with honey, yet the bees
do not collect it.&rdquo; Of the latter he remarks &ldquo;that
if it be shaken, whilst in flower, it distils a shower
of nectar.&rdquo; This observation applies more particularly
to the <i>Melianthus major</i>. And with respect
to the <i>Fritillaria</i>, Dr. Evans says, &ldquo;that the
bees do sometimes visit it; and he thinks that they
would do so oftener, but for the disagreeable fox-like
smell that emanates from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>liquidambar</i> and <i>liriodendrum</i>, or <i>tulip-tree</i>,
both which are so ornamental, the former to our
shrubberies and the latter to larger plantations,
have been much extolled, as affording food for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">- 70 -</a></span>
bees. The liquidambar bears bright saffron-coloured
flowers, and highly perfumed and glossy
leaves, and its whole rind exudes a fragrant gum.
The liriodendrum is crowned with large bell-shaped
blossoms, of every rainbow hue, which
give it a very splendid appearance.</p>

<p class="caption2">HONEY-DEW.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> term <span class="smcap">honey-dew</span> is applied to those sweet
clammy drops that glitter on the foliage of many
trees in hot weather. The name of this substance
would seem to import, that it is a deposition from
the atmosphere, and this has been the generally
received opinion respecting it, particularly among
the ancients; it is an opinion still prevalent among
the husbandmen, who suppose it to fall from the
heavens: <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> speaks of &ldquo;Aërii mellis c&#339;lestia
dona:&rdquo; and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> expresses his doubts, &ldquo;sive
ille est c&#339;li sudor, sive qu&aelig;dam siderum saliva,
sive purgantis se aëris succus.&rdquo; The Rev. <span class="smcap">Gilbert
White</span>, in his Naturalist&rsquo;s Calendar, regards
honey-dew as the effluvia of flowers, evaporated
and drawn up into the atmosphere by the heat of
the weather, and falling down again in the night
with the dews that entangle them. But if this
were the case, the fall would be indiscriminate,
and we should not have it confined to particular
trees and shrubs, nor would it be found upon
green-house and other covered plants. Some naturalists
have regarded honey-dew as an exudation
or secretion from the surface of those leaves
upon which it is found, produced by some atmospheric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">- 72 -</a></span>
stroke, which has injured their health.
<span class="smcap">Dr. Darwin</span> stands in this class. Others have
viewed it as a kind of vegetable perspiration,
which the trees emit for their relief in sultry
weather; its appearance being never observed in
a cold ungenial summer. Dr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span> is of this
opinion, and makes the following comparative remark:
&ldquo;As the glutinous sweat of the negro
enables him to bear the fervours of his native
clime, far better than the lymph-perspiring European;
so the saccharine dew of the orange, and
the fragrant gum of the Cretan cistus, may preserve
them amidst the heats even of the torrid
zone.&rdquo; Mr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span> has given it as his opinion
that the honey-dew is an excrementitious matter,
voided by the aphis or vine-fretter, an insect
which he regards as the general cause of what are
called blights. He assures us that he never, in a
single instance, observed the honey-dew unattended
with aphids.</p>

<p>I believe it will be found that <i>there are at least
two sorts of honey-dew; the one a secretion from the
surface of the leaf</i>, occasioned by one of the causes
just alluded to, <i>the other a deposition from the body
of the aphis</i>. Sir <span class="smcap">J. E. Smith</span> observes of the
sensible perspiration of plants, that &ldquo;when watery,
it can be considered only as a condensation of
their insensible evaporation, perhaps from some
sudden change in the atmosphere. Groves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">- 73 -</a></span>
poplar or willow exhibit this phenomenon, even
in England, in hot calm weather, when drops of
clear water trickle from their leaves, like a slight
shower of rain. Sometimes this secretion is of a
saccharine nature, as <span class="smcap">De la Hire</span> observed in
orange trees.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is somewhat glutinous in the
tilia or lime-tree, rather resinous in poplars, as
well as in <i>Cistus creticus</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ovid has made an
elegant use of the resinous exudations of Lombardy
poplars, which he supposes to be the tears
of Phaëton&rsquo;s sisters, who were transformed into
those trees. Such exudations must be considered
as effusions of the peculiar secretions; for it has
been observed that manna may be scraped from
the leaves of <i>Fraxinus ornus</i>, as well as be procured
from its stem by incision. They are often
perhaps a sign of unhealthiness in the plant; at
least such appears to be the nature of one kind of
honey-dew, found in particular upon the beech,
which, in consequence of an unfavourable wind,
has its leaves often covered with a sweet exudation,
similar in flavour to the liquor obtained from
its trunk. So likewise the hop, according to <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>,
is affected with the honey-dew, and its
flowers are rendered abortive, in consequence of
the attacks of the caterpillar of the Ghost moth
(<i>Phal&aelig;na Humuli</i>) upon its roots. In such case
the saccharine exudation must decidedly be of a
morbid nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">- 74 -</a></span></p>

<p>The other kind of honey-dew which is derived
from the aphis, appears to be the favourite food
of ants, and is thus spoken of by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Kirby</span>
and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>, in their late valuable Introduction to
Entomology. &ldquo;The loves of the ants and the
aphides have long been celebrated; and that there
is a connexion between them you may at any
time in the proper season, convince yourself; for
you will always find the former very busy on
those trees and plants on which the latter abound;
and if you examine more closely, you will discover
that the object of the ants, in thus attending upon
the aphides, is to obtain the saccharine fluid secreted
by them, which may well be denominated
their milk. This fluid, which is scarcely inferior
to honey in sweetness, issues in limpid drops from
the abdomen of these insects, not only by the ordinary
passage, but also by two setiform tubes
placed, one on each side, just above it. Their
sucker being inserted in the tender bark, is without
intermission employed in absorbing the sap,
which, after it has passed through the system,
they keep continually discharging by these organs.
When no ants attend them, by a certain jerk of
the body, which takes place at regular intervals,
they ejaculate it to a distance.&rdquo; The power of
ejecting the fluid from their bodies, seems to have
been wisely instituted to preserve cleanliness in
each individual fly, and indeed for the preservation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">- 75 -</a></span>
of the whole family; for pressing as they do
upon one another, they would otherwise soon be
glued together, and rendered incapable of stirring.
&ldquo;When the ants are at hand, watching the moment
at which the aphides emit their fluid, they seize
and suck it down immediately: this however is
the least of their talents; for the ants absolutely
possess the art of making the aphides yield it at
their pleasure; or in other words of milking them.&rdquo;
The ant ascends the tree, says Linn&aelig;us, <i>that it
may milk its cows the aphides</i>, not kill them.
Huber informs us that the liquor is voluntarily
given out by the aphis, when solicited by the ant,
the latter tapping the aphis gently, but repeatedly
with its antenn&aelig;, and using the same motions as
when caressing its own young. He thinks, when
the ants are not at hand to receive it, that the
aphis retains the liquor for a longer time, and
yields it freely and apparently without the least
detriment to itself, for even when it has acquired
wings, it shows no disposition to escape. A single
aphis supplies many ants with a plentiful meal.
The ants occasionally form an establishment for
their aphides, constructing a building in a secure
place, at a distance from their own city, to which,
after fortifying it, they transport those insects, and
confine them under a guard, like cows upon a
dairy farm, to supply the wants of the metropolis.
The aphides are provided with a hollow pointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">- 76 -</a></span>
proboscis, folded under the breast, when the insects
are not feeding, with which instrument they
puncture the turgid vessels of the leaf, leaf-stalk
or bark, and suck with great avidity their contents,
which are expelled nearly unchanged, so that however
fabulous it may appear, they may literally be
said to void a liquid sugar. On looking steadfastly
at a group of these insects (<i>Aphides Salicis</i>) while
feeding on the bark of the willow, their superior
size enables us to perceive some of them elevating
their bodies and emitting a transparent substance
in the form of a small shower.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Nor scorn ye now, fond elves, the foliage sear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the light aphids, arm&rsquo;d with puny spear.<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The <i>willow</i> accommodates the bees in a kind of
threefold succession, the farina of the flowers
yielding spring food for their young,&mdash;the bark
giving out propolis for sealing the hives of fresh
swarms,&mdash;and the leaves shining with honey-dew
in the midst of summer scarcity. But to return
to the aphides. &ldquo;These insects may also be seen
distinctly, with a strong magnifier, on the leaves
of the hazel, lime, &amp;c. but invariably on the inferior
surface, piercing the vessels, and expelling
the honey-dew from their hinder parts with considerable
force.&rdquo; &ldquo;These might easily have escaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">- 77 -</a></span>
the observation of the earlier philosophers,
being usually concealed within the curl of the
leaves that are punctured.&rdquo; The drops that are
spurted out, unless intercepted by the surrounding
foliage, or some other interposing body, fall upon
the ground, and the spots may often be observed,
for some time, beneath the trees affected with
honey-dew, till washed away by the rain. When
the leaves of the kidney-bean are affected by
honey-dew, their surface assumes the appearance
of having been sprinkled with soot.</p>

<p>Honey-dew usually appears upon the leaves, as
a viscid, transparent substance, sweet as honey,
sometimes in the form of globules, at others resembling
a syrup, and is generally most abundant
from the middle of June to the middle of July.</p>

<p>It is found chiefly upon the <i>oak</i>, the <i>elm</i>, the
<i>maple</i>, the <i>plane</i>, the <i>sycamore</i>, the <i>lime</i>, the <i>hazel</i>
and the <i>blackberry</i>; occasionally also on the <i>cherry</i>,
<i>currant</i>, and other fruit trees. Sometimes only
one species of trees is affected at a time. The
oak generally affords the largest quantity. At
the season of its greatest abundance, the happy
humming noise of the bees may be heard at a considerable
distance from the trees, sometimes nearly
equalling in loudness the united hum of swarming.
Of the <i>plane</i> there are two sorts; the <i>oriental</i> and
the <i>occidental</i>, both highly ornamental trees, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">- 78 -</a></span>
much regarded in hot climates for the cooling
shade they afford.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Jamque ministrantem Platanum potantibus umbram.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></p></div>

<p>The ancients so much respected the former that
they used to refresh its roots with wine instead of
water, believing, as Sir William Temple has observed,
that &ldquo;this tree loved that liquor, as well as
those who used to drink under its shade.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Crevit et affuso latior umbra mero.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></p></div>

<p>The <i>sycamore</i> has been discarded from the situation
it used formerly to hold, near the mansions
of the convivial, owing to the bees crowding to
banquet on its profusion of honey-dew, and occasioning
an early fall of its leaves. The <i>lime</i> or
<i>linden</i> tree has been regarded as doubly acceptable
to the bees, on account of its fragrant blossoms
and its honey-dewed leaves appearing both together,
amidst the oppressive heats of the dog-days;
but it seems doubtful whether the flowers
have any attraction but their fragrance, as they
are said to have no honey-cup.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to apiarians who reside
in the vicinity of such trees as are apt to be
affected with honey-dew, to keep their bees on
the storifying plan, where additional room can at
all times be provided for them at pleasure, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">- 79 -</a></span>
during the time of a honey-dew, more honey will
be collected in one week than will be afforded by
flowers in several. So great is the ardour of the
bees on these occasions, and so rapid are their
movements, that it is often dangerous to be placed
betwixt the hives and the dews.</p>

<p>That species of honey-dew which is secreted
from the surface of the leaves, appears to have
been first noticed by the <span class="smcap">Abbé Boissier de Sauvages</span>.
He observed it upon the old leaves of
the holm-oak and upon those of the blackberry,
but not upon the young leaves of either; and he
remarked at the same time, that neighbouring
trees of a different sort were exempt from it:
among these latter he noticed the mulberry tree,
&ldquo;which,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is a very particular circumstance,
for this juice&rdquo; (honey-dew) &ldquo;is a deadly
poison to silk-worms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some years do not afford any honey-dew, it
generally occurs pretty extensively once in four
or five years.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">PURCHASE OF BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">E</span>very</span> one who meditates the establishment of
an apiary, should be able to distinguish a good
from a bad hive of bees, that he may detect imposition,
if it should be attempted, when he is purchasing
his first swarms or stocks. Bees are
commonly purchased in the spring or in the autumn.
The value of a hive of bees, purchased
in the spring, if it be a recent swarm, may be
ascertained by its weight, which should not be
less than four or five pounds, on the day of swarming.
But the weight <i>alone</i>, of a <i>stock</i> hive, is not
a criterion of its worth; several other circumstances
are to be considered,&mdash;for the worst <i>stock</i>
hives often weigh the heaviest. Still if a stock-hive
be a swarm of the current year, which is always
desirable, weight may be regarded <i>in a
great</i> degree, as a <i>criterion of value</i>, its quantity
of heterogeneous matters being probably inconsiderable.
Such a hive, purchased in the autumn,
should not weigh less than from twenty-five
to thirty pounds, and should contain about half a
bushel of bees.</p>

<p>There are surer grounds, however, upon which
its value may be determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">- 81 -</a></span></p>

<p>1st. The combs should be of a pale colour, as
dark ones denote age; though even in this there
may be deception, for old combs may be lengthened
out and bordered with new wax.</p>

<p>2ndly. The combs should be worked down to
the floor of the hive.</p>

<p>3rdly. The interstices of the combs should be
crowded with bees.</p>

<p>All these points may be safely ascertained, by
gently turning up the hive in an evening, when
the bees are at rest. It may be well also to notice
the proceedings of the bees in the day-time. If
when they quit the hive, to range the fields, they
depart in quick succession and without lingering
about; and if the entrance be well guarded by
sentinels; these are pretty sure indications of a
prosperous hive.</p>

<p>The hive, when purchased, should be raised
gently from the stool, some hours prior to its removal,
and be supported by wedges, that the bees
may not cluster on the floor, as this would be
productive of inconvenience at the time of their
removal. After being wedged up, the hive should
remain undisturbed till night, when, being placed
upon a proper board, it should be carried away
carefully, and placed at once where it is intended
to remain, unless it be a recent swarm which is to
be removed into a box.&mdash;The mode of proceeding
in this case will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>The bees of a hive, recently removed, if purchased
of a near neighbour, or if the weather be
cold, should be confined for a day or two, or else
many of them, after flying about in quest of provision,
will be lost; in the one case, by returning
to their old habitation, and in the other, by being
chilled to death, in searching for their new one.</p>

<p class="caption2">BEE-BOXES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>here</span> has been some difference of opinion as to
<i>the most suitable dimensions of bee-boxes</i>. I prefer
those of Keys, which are twelve inches square
and nine inches deep, <i>in the clear</i>. The <i>best wood</i>
for them is <i>red cedar</i>, the fragrance of which is
regarded by some as agreeable to the bees; but
the chief grounds of preference are its effect in
keeping moths out of the boxes, and its being a
bad conductor of heat, from its lightness and
sponginess. Whatever kind of wood be made
use of, it should be well seasoned; <i>yellow deal</i>
answers the purpose very well. The sides of the
boxes should be an inch thick, and the bars on
the top three quarters of an inch, about an inch
and half wide, and six in number, which will leave
an interspace between each of about half an inch.
At the back of each box, a pane of glass should
be fixed in a small rabbet, which may be covered
with a half inch door, hung with wire hinges and
fastened by a button.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">- 84 -</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The size of the door may be suited to the wishes
of the apiarian: as this door will only give a view
of the centre combs, in case of their being constructed
in a line with the bars, or of one or more
of the external combs, in case of their being attached
at right angles with the bars or diagonally,
it will be desirable to have a pane of glass in each
side also, that the proprietor may be enabled to
judge at any time of the stock of honey contained
in the box. These small glass windows will seldom
do more than afford the proprietor an opportunity
of ascertaining the strength of his stock of
bees, and the quantity of honey they have in store;
if he wish to see more particularly the operations
of the labourers, or to witness the survey which
the queen now and then takes of them, he may
have a large bell-glass, surmounted by a straw-hive,
which latter may be occasionally raised, for
the purpose of inspection.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;By this blest art our ravish&rsquo;d eyes behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The singing Masons build their roofs of gold,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">- 85 -</a></span>

</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>An opportunity of beholding the proceedings
of the queen is so very rarely afforded, that many
apiarians have passed their lives without enjoying
it; and Reaumur himself, even with the assistance
of a glass-hive, acknowledges that he was many
years before he had that pleasure. Those who have
been so fortunate, agree in representing her majesty
as being very slow and dignified in her movements,
and as being constantly surrounded by a
guard of about a dozen bees, who seem to pay her
great homage, and always to have their faces turned
towards her, like courtiers, in the presence of
royalty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But mark, of royal port, and awful mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where moves with measur&rsquo;d pace the <span class="smcap">Insect Queen</span>!<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Bend at her nod, and round her person wait.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>Mr. Dunbar&rsquo;s observations, upon the movements
of the queen in his mirror-hive, do not
correspond altogether with what is here stated.
He says that he did not find her majesty attended
in her progress by a guard, but that wherever she
moved the way was cleared; that the heads of
the workers whom she passed upon her route were
always turned towards her, that they fawned upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">- 86 -</a></span>
and caressed her, touching her softly with their
antenn&aelig;; but that as soon as she moved onwards,
they resumed their labours, whilst all that she
passed in succession paid her the same homage.
This sort of <i>homage</i> is only <i>paid to fertile queens;</i>
whilst they continue virgins, they are not treated
with much respect.</p>

<p>The queen is very numerously surrounded, when
depositing her first eggs in the cells, her attendants
then cling to one another and form a living
curtain before her, so completely impenetrable to
our eyes, as to preclude all observation of her
proceedings; unless the apiarian use the leaf-hive
of Huber, or the mirror-hive of Dunbar, it is
hardly possible to snatch a sight of her, excepting
when she lays her eggs near the exterior parts of
the combs. The manner in which bees attach
themselves to each other, when forming a curtain,
or when suspending themselves from a bough, or
taking their repose, is, by each bee, with its two
fore-claws, taking hold of the two hinder legs of
the one next above it, thus forming as it were a
perfect grape-like cluster or living garland. Even
when thus intertwined with each other, as Swammerdam
has observed, they can fly off&rsquo; from the
bunch, and perch on it again, or make their way
out from the very centre of the cluster, and rush
into the air. This mode of suspension, so voluntarily
adopted, must be agreeable to them, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">- 87 -</a></span>
the uppermost bees evidently bear the weight of
all the rest. Mr. Wildman supposes that they
have a power of distending themselves with air,
like fishes, by which they acquire buoyancy.</p>

<p>Each set of boxes must have one <i>close cover</i>,
which should be an inch thick and well clamped
at each end to prevent warping, as a considerable
quantity of steam arises from the bees at certain
seasons. The top, being intended to take off and
on, should be secured by means of four screws,
each placed about an inch and a half from the
respective corners; and it should also be fitted
to, and screwed down upon, all the boxes before
any of them are used, that whenever it may be
necessary to remove, or to add a box, the change
may be effected with the utmost promptitude.
Long taper screws, as nearly of the same size as
possible, should be selected for fastening on the
tops, and be dipped in grease before put in, to facilitate
their removal. Each set of boxes must
also have a <i>loose floor</i>, an inch thick and extending
about an inch and half beyond the back and
sides of the boxes. The outlet for the bees is
usually cut in the lower edge of the boxes, but I
have found it much more convenient to have it
formed by sinking the floor half of its thickness
at the centre of its front edge. The width of the
part sunk should be about four inches, and should
gradually diminish in depth till it reach the centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">- 88 -</a></span>
of the board. The sloping direction thus given
will, in case of beating rain or condensed steam
falling upon it, prevent any wet from lodging within
the hive. The floor must also be clamped at
the ends, to prevent warping, though the superincumbent
weight renders it less liable to be warped
than the top. Either on the right or left hand
side of the entrance, as may be most convenient, a
<i>groove</i> must be cut half an inch deep and half an
inch wide; to this groove a <i>slide</i> must be fitted
(made to run easily), for the purpose of closing the
box, and preventing the egress or ingress of the
bees, as occasion may require.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/page88.png" width="240" height="197" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A <i>centre board</i> between each tier of boxes will
likewise be convenient; it should be of the same
size as the floor, and have an oblong hole about
six inches by four in the middle, to give liberty to
the bees to pass from box to box. Apiaries should
always have a few supernumerary boards of each
sort, and also some supernumerary boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">- 89 -</a></span></p>

<p>As the boxes and boards require to be made
with great accuracy, that they may be nicely
adapted to each other, a good joiner should be
employed to construct them; for if there be any
crevices the bees will, according to their invariable
custom, fill them with propolis, and thereby waste
their valuable time. The square boxes which I
have described are the simplest of any, in their
form: some persons prefer the octagon or hexagon
form; in some situations, if windows be placed
in the three posterior sides, those forms may be
more convenient for exhibiting the operations of
the bees, or the store of honey in the combs; but
they are more expensive and more cumbrous, if
made as capacious as the square ones; and these
latter answer the intended purposes so well, as to
satisfy completely those who have used them.
Although I have endeavoured to give a clear description
of the form and mode of constructing a
bee-box and its appendages, probably it may be
more satisfactory to young beginners to obtain a
sight or a model of them, I refer them therefore
to Mr. Hughes, joiner, Ross, Herefordshire, or to
Mr. John Milton, 10, Great Marybone Street.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss this part of my subject, without
saying a few words respecting <i>the hive of
Huish</i>, which is contrived with the view of allowing
the removal of the exterior bars, that support
the honey-combs, without disturbing the brood-combs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">- 90 -</a></span>
The principle of this hive appears to be
very good, but I doubt whether it will come into
general use; for as bees are not very tractable
creatures, they are not likely to construct their
combs in direct lines, so as to attach one singly to
each of Mr. Huish&rsquo;s bars: the tops of the boxes
which I use are constructed like Huish&rsquo;s, yet I
never saw an instance in which the combs did not
either cross those bars at right angles, or connect
themselves in some way or other with two or
three bars, so as to render it impracticable to remove
a comb or two from the outsides, in the
manner that Huish proposes. The sole advantage
of Huish&rsquo;s hive consists in this undisturbing
mode of removal; and could it be effected,
honey might be extracted without withdrawing
any of the stored pollen or propolis, or molesting
the brood in the centre combs; an inconvenience
which, it must be admitted, may be charged upon
the storifying system, though I hope I have, in my
chapter or Deprivation, pointed out a method that
will, in a very great degree, if not entirely, remedy
this inconvenience. Huish, in his instructions
for using his hives, admits the difficulty
which I have here stated, as to the attachment of
a single comb to more than one bar, and gives
particular directions how to proceed on such occasions;
but even under tolerably favourable circumstances,
the recommended operation would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">- 91 -</a></span>
require considerable nicety, and no small portion
of courage; in some cases the difficulty would
be completely insurmountable. A hive very similar
to that of Huish is described in Wheeler&rsquo;s
Travels. He states it to be in use in the neighbourhood
of Mount Hymettus. &ldquo;The hives,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;in which they keep their bees, are
made of willow or osiers fashioned like our common
dust-baskets, wide at top and narrow at bottom.&rdquo;
&ldquo;These tops are covered with broad flat
sticks, along which the bees fasten their combs,
so that a comb may be taken out whole.&rdquo; We
are informed, by Reaumur and Du Hamel, that
this Greek method of keeping bees and taking
honey was introduced into France in 1754. If
it had succeeded, either in France or in this country,
I think we should have heard more of it.</p>

<p>The only way in which I conceive that Huish&rsquo;s
idea can be followed up effectually, is, by employing
the experimental hive of Huber; but the majority
of persons who undertake the management
of bees, will look to them as a source of profit;
and to these the expense of such a hive would
render it completely unavailable. Huber&rsquo;s first
experiments were made in single leaf-hives an
inch and a half wide; his latter trials, on several
of these connected together, each an inch and a
quarter wide, which left the same room for the
passage of the bees as the single hive. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI.</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">- 92 -</a></span>
Reaumur&rsquo;s hives consisted of wooden
frames, with glass windows, but of such a width,
as to allow the bees to construct two combs parallel
to each other. This form is unfavourable,
inasmuch as it conceals from the observer whatever
passes between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorley, who practised the plan of super-hiving,
surmounted his <i>octagon boxes</i> and flat-topped
hives, with a <i>large bell-glass</i>, over which
he placed a common straw-hive, to take on and
off. From an extract which I have made from
Dr. Evans&rsquo;s book in the chapter on Instincts, he
appears to have adopted this method.</p>

<p>It was by the aid of similar glasses that Maraldi
was enabled to give to the world so accurate
an account of the natural history and labours of
bees.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Wildman also, in addition to his usual mode of
keeping bees, upon the storifying plan, occasionally
employed flat-topped hives surmounted by a
large bell-glass; and at the close of his Treatise
we are informed that he had latterly adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">- 93 -</a></span>
another method of super-hiving, which is still
practised by apiarians of the present day. Instead
of employing one large glass, he made use
of <i>four</i> or <i>five small ones</i>, each holding about a
pint; and those who are fond of using honey fresh
from the hive, will find this a convenient mode of
keeping their bees, though probably not so profitable
a one as the general plan of storifying. A
stock of these hives and glasses, on the most approved
construction, is kept constantly ready
for sale at Mr. John Milton&rsquo;s, 10, Great Marybone
Street. The bees, upon this plan, are
hived in the usual way, the top board being kept
closed, till the glasses are placed over it, which
may be done as soon as convenient after the hive
has been put in the situation in which it is intended
to remain. The glasses and top board should
be covered with a common straw-hive, to exclude
the light, as bees are found to work best in the
dark. When the glasses are sufficiently filled
with combs and honey,&mdash;and this period will very
much depend upon the season,&mdash;if the bees still remain
in them, placing an empty hive under the
full one win generally cause them to descend,
and facilitate the removal of the glasses, which
may take place as often as the harvest of honey
will admit, consistently with the leaving of a
full winter&rsquo;s supply for the bees. See chapter
on Nadir-hiving. The usual mode of taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">- 94 -</a></span>
the honey in these glasses is, first to cut off
the communication between them and the hive
on which they stand, by loosening the thumbscrew
in the centre, and turning the board so far
round as to close the openings; then, by means of
a thin spatula, separating the glasses from their
adhesion, and either carrying them, inverted, a
short distance from the hive, into a shady place,
or raising each glass by means of a wedge, and
leaving it thus for about an hour. In either case
the bees will quit the glasses and return to the
family by the usual entrance. To effect the removal,
I think it preferable to use two flat pieces
of tin, after the manner of dividers, placing the
tins successively under each glass, carrying it away
upon one, and leaving the other over the opening
till the glass has been emptied and replaced or
another substituted in its room: and where it is
wished to take only one or two glasses, this mode
must always be adopted. The bees will rarely
fill more than one set of glasses, during the first
year; though in future years, if the season be favourable,
they may be expected to fill two sets.
The best time for removal is the middle of a fine
day, when the greatest number of bees are roaming
the fields. This method of management will
not prevent the bees from swarming, unless it be
combined with storifying, which it very easily
may.</p>

<p class="caption2">HIVES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">B</span>ee-hives</span> have been formed with various materials,
the selection of which has depended partly
upon the country or district in which they have
been used, and partly upon the fancy of the apiarian.
<i>Osiers</i>, <i>rushes</i>, <i>segs</i> and <i>straw</i> have all
been in requisition for forming hives, and Bonner,
an eminent bee-master in Scotland, proposes
to have them made of <i>earthenware</i>. In North
America, according to Brookes, they are formed
out of <i>the hollow trunks of the liquidambar tree</i>,
cut to a proper length and covered with a board
to keep out the rain: for the same purpose the
people in Apulia use <i>the trunk of the giant fennel</i>,
after clearing away its fungous pith. In Egypt,
says Hasselquist, bee-keepers make their hives of
<i>coal dust and clay</i>, which being well blended together,
is formed into hollow cylinders, of a span
diameter, and from six to twelve feet long; these
being dried in the sun, become so hard as to be
handled at will. &ldquo;I saw some thousands of these
hives,&rdquo; says our author, &ldquo;at a village between
Damietta and Mansora; they composed a wall
round a house, after having become unserviceable
in the use they were first made for.&rdquo;&mdash;Voyages

and Travels in the Levant, &amp;c. By Fred. Hasselquist,
B.D.</p>

<p>Under the head of Storifying, I have given a
history of the discovery and progressive improvement
of boxes and storifying hives, and shall
chiefly confine myself, in this chapter, to the form
and dimensions of hives. The common bell-shaped
straw-hives used by the cottagers are too
well known to need remark. Premising, therefore,
that the <i>Chelmsford</i> and <i>Hertford hives</i> are
considered as the handsomest shaped and best
formed, I shall limit my observations to the <i>straw</i> hives
which may be employed for storifying, as
some persons may prefer straw to wood. These
have been called <i>Moreton-hives</i>, on account of
their form <i>only</i>, the material of which they were
made being reeds and not straw. The <i>best straw</i>
for constructing hives is that of <i>unblighted rye,
and unthrashed</i> is preferable to thrashed straw;
for being smooth and entire, the bees will be
spared a good deal of trouble, as they invariably
nibble away the rough sharp spicul&aelig; that they
find on the inner surface of a new hive. The
ears of corn may be dissevered from the straw
by a chaff-cutter, and thrashed with other corn.
The most approved size for a storifying straw-hive
is nine inches high by twelve inches wide, <i>in
the clear</i>, the diameter being the same from top
to bottom. The importance of having all bee-boxes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">- 97 -</a></span>
made of the same dimensions has been already
dwelt upon, and it is of course of equal importance
with respect to straw-hives. The upper
and lower edges should be made as smooth as
possible; which effect will be greatly promoted,
by placing them, soon after making, between two
flat boards with a 56lb. weight upon the uppermost,
and leaving them in that position for a day
or two. Within the upper row of straw, a small
hoop should be worked, for the purpose of nailing
a board or some wooden bars to it, and within
the bottom row a piece of wood should also be
worked over the part where the bees are to pass
in and out, to allow of a more easy movement of
the slide in the floor board. It would be an improvement
if the hoop were perforated through
its whole course with a wimble bit, that it might
be stitched with willow or bramble splits, to the
upper round of straw, instead of being worked in
with it; and if a hoop were also stitched in a similar
manner to the lower round of straw, the lower
edge of it could be planed, sufficiently smooth, to
lie on the middle or floor boards, as closely as a
box, which would render the use of mortar or
other luting unnecessary. The stitch holes in
the hoop should be filled with putty, after the
hive has been finished. If bars be made use of,
they should be of the same width, and placed at
the same distances from each other, as recommended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">- 98 -</a></span>
for the boxes, and the vacancies, that
would otherwise be left between the ends of the
bars, should be made quite level, with bits of
wood, cow-dung, or any other convenient substance.
If a single board be used, that, of course,
must be cut into bars of the proper widths. The
direction of the bars should always be from front
to back.</p>

<p>Middle boards and floors will be equally required
for storifying hives as for boxes; but the outside
covers should be made of straw, like round mats,
and be wide enough to extend an inch beyond the
edges of the hives, if used in an out-door apiary.
The whole story should be covered with a good
<i>hackel</i> or <i>cap</i>, secured in its place by an iron
hoop or a properly weighted wooden one, to prevent
it from being blown down. As clean fresh
rye straw is most suitable for constructing the
hive itself, so it will be the best for forming the
hackel with: the latter should be changed before
it begins to decay, that it may not become offensive
to the bees from its odour, nor be selected
by insects as a nidus for their eggs.</p>

<p>The apiarian, if he be desirous of having glass
windows in his straw-hives, may accomplish this
object by cutting with a sharp knife through two
of the bands of straw, in two places, about three
inches asunder. The windows are generally cut
opposite the entrance, and about the centre, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">- 99 -</a></span>
may be made at any part of the hive. The ends
of the cut straw-bands may be secured by stitches
of packthread, or, what is better, with softened
mole snap wire, and the panes of glass may be
fastened with putty.</p>

<p>Out-door hives should have a protection not
only of straw caps, but of a <i>shed</i> also, which if
made open in <i>front only</i>, would afford much shelter
against driving rains and high winds; but the
most complete shed is made with folding or sliding
doors <i>at the back</i>, and is closed at the sides,
and in front, with the exception of such openings
as may be necessary for the entrance of the bees
and for their accommodation in bad weather. This
shed renders hackels unnecessary, and is adapted
either to storifying or single-hiving. In the annexed
plate is a back view of it, with hives arranged
in different ways.</p>

<p class="caption2">COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF WOODEN
BOXES AND STRAW HIVES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">M</span>ost</span> of the writers who have instituted a comparison
between hives and boxes, have decided in
favour of the former. But it is to be recollected
that when forming this decision, these writers have
always had in their minds an out-door apiary,
for which situation, on account of their exposure to
the variations of temperature and the alternations
of drought and moisture, straw-hives possess advantages
over wooden boxes;&mdash;they are not so
soon affected by a hot and dry or by a moist atmosphere;
they do not part with so much heat
in winter nor admit so much in summer, straw
being, in the language of the chemists, a bad conductor
of heat. Being much cheaper than any
others, straw-hives are of course chosen by the
cottager.</p>

<p>Upon the storifying system, and with the advantage
of a bee-house, I think wooden boxes
have a great superiority over straw-hives; they
are more firm and steady, better suited for observing
the operations of the bees through the
glass windows in the backs and sides, and less liable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">- 101 -</a></span>
to harbour moths, spiders, and other insects;
they permit the combs, at the period of deprivation,
to be more easily separated from the sides

<p class="caption2">LEAF HIVES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">N</span>arrow</span> hives, with large glazed doors on each
side, have been recommended by apiarian writers,
for exposing the operations of bees. That
of <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> was too wide: it allowed the construction
of two parallel combs, by which of
course, the apiarian was precluded from making
any useful observations, upon the proceedings of
the bees, in their interspace. <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> recommended
the use of a hive, the doors of which
should be only so far asunder as to allow the
building of one comb between them. This suggestion
was successfully adopted by <span class="smcap">Huber</span>; and to
prevent the bees from building short transverse
combs, instead of a single one, parallel to the
sides of the hive, he laid the foundation himself,
by fastening a piece of empty comb to the ceiling
of the box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huber&rsquo;s</span> glass doors had only an interspace of
an inch and half betwixt them: in this hive the
bees could not cluster upon the surfaces of the
comb, and yet had room to pass freely over it.
Mr. <span class="smcap">John Hunter</span> recommended the diameter of
these narrow hives to be three inches, and the superficies
of the sides to be of sufficient size to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">- 103 -</a></span>
afford stowage for a summer&rsquo;s work. Mr. <span class="smcap">Dunbar</span>,
with his mirror-hive, constructed somewhat
like Huber&rsquo;s, has been able to make some interesting
observations on the &#339;conomy of the bee. <i>Vide</i>
Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, vol. iii. The
distance of his glass doors from each other is one
inch and two thirds; the height and width of the
hive, according to the plan in the Journal, about
a foot. Across the centre of the mirror-hive Mr.
Dunbar introduced a light frame, which though
apparently dividing the hive into four compartments,
allowed the bees a free passage: they were
skreened from the light by a pair of folding shutters
on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunbar hived a small swarm in one of
these narrow boxes, in June 1819: the bees began
to build immediately, and he witnessed the whole
of their proceedings, every bee being exposed to
his view. The narrowness of their limits constrained
them, from the very commencement, to
work in divisions, so that four separate portions
of comb were begun and continued nearly at the
same time.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 203px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">- 104 -</a></span></p>

<p>But this arrangement did not sufficiently employ
these industrious creatures; for contrary to their
usual mode of building, which is from above downwards,
they laid two other foundations of comb,
upon the upper parts of the cross sticks.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/page104a.png" width="205" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The bees now wrought upwards and downwards
at the same time, till the originally separate portions
were united and become one comb.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/page104b.png" width="221" height="160" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For want of proper precautions, the bees of this
hive perished, during the intense cold of January
1820.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March following, Mr. Dunbar
introduced another swarm into the same unicomb
hive; and so early as the 27th, he saw the queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">- 105 -</a></span>
laying the eggs of workers. This second swarm
found plenty of honey and farina in the hive, left
by its former tenants. Other particulars reported
by Mr. Dunbar are detailed in the Chapters to
which they belong.</p>

<p>These hives are of course only useful to the
amateur apiarian, who is in quest of information
or amusement.</p>

<p>Huber carried the principle of this hive still
further: he joined several thin boxes together
with hinges: these boxes or wooden frames were
without glasses, and the hinges were so contrived
as to admit of easy removal. Every box or leaf
(as Huber called each separate frame), except the
two exterior, was reduced in thickness to an inch
and quarter, which, as there was a free communication
between all the leaves, afforded the same
liberty for the operations of the bees as the single
box that was an inch and half wide. This contrivance
gave him the power of opening the leaves
separately, and inspecting the proceedings of the
bees at all times: they soon became accustomed
to this treatment, and M. Huber was thus able to
examine any one of the divisions, without exciting
the anger of the bees. After they had properly
secured the pieces of comb which he had attached
to the roofs of the boxes, they were subjected to
a daily inspection by this indefatigable naturalist.</p>

in the unicomb hive, and the following outline
may give them a notion of the compound hive.</p>

<p class="caption2">DIVIDERS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> apiarian who adopts the storifying plan,
should have <i>Keys&rsquo;s dividers</i>, which consist of two
copper or brass plates, about the sixteenth of an
inch thick, fifteen inches wide, and fifteen and a
half long; the odd half inch, being turned up,
serves for the operator to lay hold of, when the
plates are withdrawn. Care should be taken that
the plates be perfect planes, well hardened by
hammering, and of proper thickness. If they exceed
the prescribed thickness, the bees may escape
as soon as the plates are partially introduced or
partially withdrawn; and if they be thinner, there
will be the same chance of escape from their want
of firmness and elasticity.</p>

<p>These dividers greatly facilitate the various
operations which the apiarian has to perform,
and at the same time secure him from the attacks
of the bees.</p>

<p>He should be provided with one of the <i>long-bladed
spatulas</i> or knives, used by apothecaries
and painters, which he will find useful in separating
the honey-combs from the sides of the hives
or boxes. In some cases it will also be necessary
to have <i>an iron instrument</i>, about ten inches long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">- 108 -</a></span>
and half an inch wide, the end of which should be
<i>turned up about two inches</i> and be <i>double-edged</i>,
that it may cut both ways. This instrument,
which should be fixed in a wooden handle, being
passed between the combs, will enable the operator
to separate them from their attachment to the
bars.</p>

<p>Those who make use of the Moreton-hives,&mdash;a
description of which is given in the chapter on
Hives,&mdash;should be furnished with two strips of
tin four inches by fifteen; these will protect the
straw bottoms of the upper hives during the introduction
of the dividers, and should be introduced
one on each side, the hives having been previously
dissevered by means of the spatula.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to accomplish this

<span class="smcap">Madame Vicat</span> placed them collaterally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">- 110 -</a></span></p>

<p>Hives and boxes for storifying, as well as for observing
the operations of the bees, have been made
of various forms and dimensions, and of different
materials: such as straw, osiers, glass, and wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, <span class="smcap">Pliny</span>, and other ancient writers,
speak of contrivances for taking honey, and inspecting
the operations of the bees. Modern
writers, particularly <span class="smcap">Mouffet</span>, ridiculed the ineffectual
schemes of their brethren of antiquity,
and indeed they were very soon abandoned. The
way in which <i>they</i> endeavoured to accomplish
their objects, was by the introduction of transparent
substances into the sides of the hives or
boxes, such as <i>isinglass</i>, <i>horn</i> (<i>cornu laterna</i>),
<i>pellucid stone</i> (<i>lapis specularis</i>), probably <i>talc</i>,
which is still used in the Russian navy for cabin
windows, on account of its not being liable to
break by the percussion of the air during the
firing of cannon, or in tempestuous weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hartlib&rsquo;s</span> <i>Commonwealth of Bees</i>, published
in 1655, contains the first account, I have seen,
of bee-boxes being employed in this country. He
speaks of &ldquo;an experiment of glassen hives invented
by Mr. <span class="smcap">W. Mew</span>, Minister of Easlington
in Gloucestershire: his boxes were of an octagon
shape, and had a glass window in the back.&rdquo; Soon
after, in the year 1675, <span class="smcap">Jno. Gedde</span>, Esq. published,
&ldquo;<i>A new discovery of an excellent method
of Bee-houses and Colonies</i>,&rdquo; which was intended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">- 111 -</a></span>
preserve the lives of the bees: he obtained a
patent for his boxes from King Charles.</p>

<p>Gedde&rsquo;s boxes were considerably improved by
<span class="smcap">Joseph Warder</span>, a physician at Croydon, who
published an account of them in his work entitled
&ldquo;<i>The true Amazons, or the Monarchy of Bees</i>.&rdquo; Dr.
Warder enriched his account with several curious
circumstances respecting bees; some of which
will be detailed in a future chapter. The method of
these gentlemen seems not to have been generally
known; for even Swammerdam, who published
in 1680, makes no mention of it. Had Swammerdam
known it, he would have been informed
of many circumstances, respecting which he was
evidently ignorant. This want of Dr. Warder&rsquo;s
information is to be lamented, for Swammerdam
was an accurate observer, and a faithful reporter
of what he did observe.</p>

<p>Gedde and Warder were succeeded by the Rev.
<span class="smcap">John Thorley</span> of Oxford, who published &ldquo;<i>An
Enquiry into the Nature, Order, and Government
of Bees</i>;&rdquo; and by the Rev. <span class="smcap">Stephen White</span> of
Halton in Suffolk, who wrote on &ldquo;<i>Collateral
Bee-boxes, or an easy and advantageous method of
managing Bees</i>.&rdquo; Collateral boxes have been
objected to, because bees, when the boxes are
on a level, have laid their eggs promiscuously in
both; moreover side boxes occupy a great deal
more room than storifying boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">- 112 -</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorley&rsquo;s son</span> improved the method of
his father. The indefatigable Mr. <span class="smcap">Wildman</span> devoted
much of his time to the same subject: to
him we are principally indebted for the present
perfection of bee-boxes, and particularly for obtaining
fresh honey throughout the season, by
means of small glasses ranged upon a flat-topped
hive. <i>Vide</i> pages <a href="#Page_93">93</a> and <a href="#Page_99">99</a>.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Vicat</span>, a very ingenious lady in Switzerland,
published, in the Memoirs of the Berne
Society, some very judicious <i>Observations on bees
and hives</i>. She was the first who hinted, that
upon the storifying plan, the duplets and triplets
should always be placed under the full hives; as
the bees, in constructing fresh works, evidently
prefer descending to ascending.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have Mr. <span class="smcap">Keys&rsquo;s</span> very useful book,
"<i>The ancient Bee-master&rsquo;s Farewell</i>," which has
long been a standard work to the practical apiarian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">- 113 -</a></span></p>

<p>Keys states, that upon the storifying plan, three
pecks of bees will collect more honey in a season,
than four pecks divided into two families, upon
the common plan, and that the proportion of pure
honey and pure wax will likewise be greater. He
observes, that a good storified colony has, under
favourable circumstances, received an accession of
thirty pounds of honey in seven days; whereas if
a swarm had been sent off, the increase, in the
same period, would not, probably, have been more
than five pounds.</p>

<p>This difference of increase is owing, I conceive,
to the divided family occupying a larger proportion
of its workers as nurses, than the storified family
employs, there being in the former the brood of
two queens, in the latter the brood of only one, to
be attended to. The one establishment is in fact
divided, so as to form two establishments, and
there must be of course, an observance of the
accustomed peculiarities of dignity and office, in
each of the two, as there was in the one; consequently,
fewer collecting bees can be spared from
the divided family, than would have been at liberty
in their undivided state; and this reasoning will
apply with increasing force as the number of
duplets and triplets is increased.</p>

<p>In single-hiving, if rainy weather occur at the
time the bees are prepared to throw off a swarm,
and the hive be filled with comb to its utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">- 114 -</a></span>
limit, all the bees must remain idle till the return
of fine weather; whereas if more room be given,
as upon the storifying plan, they will, by embracing
every opportunity for collecting, and by constructing
fresh combs by means of the stores already
collected, be enabled to diminish that check
to their activity, which wet weather always occasions.
Though rainy weather has this effect upon
the bees, yet are they much less susceptible to
moisture than to cold: they may frequently be
seen in full activity upon a warm showery day,
whereas on a cold dry one, they cluster closely
together within the hives. The colder the weather
the more closely they cluster. &ldquo;When the lime-tree
and black grain blossom,&rdquo; says Huber, &ldquo;they
brave the rain, they depart before sun-rise, and
return later than ordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Independently of the benefit derived from storifying,
as congregating a numerous body of bees
together, it will always be found advantageous to
have hives of whatever sort well filled, as the bees
uniformly work best when in a numerous body:
this has induced Mr. Espinasse and others strongly
to recommend the union of stocks that do not
well fill the hives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">SWARMING.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">H</span>owever</span> populous a stock of bees may be in the
autumn, its numbers are greatly reduced during
winter, perhaps about six or seven eighths. This
loss is more than replaced in the spring, by the
amazing fecundity of the queen. Hence arises a disposition
to throw off swarms, which, of course, will
issue more or less frequently, more or less early,
and in greater or less force, according to the temperature
of the season, the fertility of the queen,
the populousness of the stock, and the attention
that has been paid to early feeding.</p>

<p>It is a prevalent opinion, that a swarm consists
entirely of young bees; but this is an error: every
swarm contains a mixture of young and old; the
latter are distinguishable by being of a redder
hue, and having ragged wings.</p>

<p><i>In favourable seasons, a good stock will throw
off three swarms, even a swarm of the current year
will sometimes throw off another swarm</i>; in this
latter case, there is but a small collection of honey,
compared with the great number of bees which
have been called into existence. I have endeavoured
to account for this in <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>. In the
Monthly Magazine, for Sept. 1825, an instance is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">- 116 -</a></span>
recorded of five swarms being thrown off and
hived before the end of July from planting one
single stock; the season was favourable, and the
situation, (High Armaside in Lorton), particularly
so. They were not all thrown off from the first
or parent stock, but from that and the earliest
swarm. Bosc, the French consul in Carolina, has
stated that he had eleven swarms in one season
from a single stock; and that each of those swarms,
during the same season, threw off the same number
of secondary ones!!!! The space which usually
intervenes between the first and second swarm is
from seven to nine days; between the second and
third, the period is shorter; and if there should be
a fourth, it may depart the day after that which
precedes it.</p>

<p>This succession of swarms must be owing to
the great number of young queens that obtain
their liberty. As they greatly weaken the parent
stock, and are naturally weak themselves, the
only resource under such circumstances is the
union of two or more of the swarms into one
family.</p>

<p><i>March is the month in which the grand laying of
the queen usually commences</i>; yet when January
proves mild, the breeding will sometimes begin
at the latter end of <i>that</i> month, and it is by no
means an uncommon thing for the commencement
to happen in February. The queen-bee may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">- 117 -</a></span>
naturally be expected to breed earlier in the season
than insects in general, from the circumstance
of the working-bees storing up food for the young,
which other insects, that breed later, do not; as
also from her living in the midst of a society which
preserves a summer heat during the coldest
months of winter. A thermometer in a bee-hive
has ranged as high as 74&deg; Fahrenheit at Christmas;
and Bonner says that he has often seen his hives
with young brood in them in the midst of a severe
frost. In the Transactions of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hubbard</span> has
stated that vigorous well-stored hives breed even
in the depth of winter. In this perhaps he was
mistaken; the finding of eggs and maggots in the
cells does not satisfy my mind, as they might have
been laid late in the autumn, and have remained
stationary till spring. Riem states, that in a bad
season the eggs will remain in the cells many
months without hatching. Mr. Hubbard was led
to make the experiment of suffocating a strong
stock in February, to ascertain the state of the
brood-combs; in which he says that he found an
abundance of brood, in every state, from that of
egg to the almost perfect fly; although the preceding
January had been very cold, accompanied
by frost and snow,&mdash;a circumstance which in some
measure confirms my supposition, as to the suspended
development of the brood. Mr. Hubbard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">- 118 -</a></span>
further adds, that on examining two weak hives,
in March and April, he found not a single egg.
From these very opposite states <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> infers
the great importance of leaving stocks strong in
October, and feeding them in an ungenial autumn,
conceiving that the bees apportion the numbers of
their young to the means they possess of supporting
them. That</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The prescient Female rears her tender brood<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In strict proportion to the hoarded food.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, however, does not correspond with what will
be stated below; from which it will appear, that
the queen sometimes lays eggs, in reliance upon
an approaching season, and does not let the number
altogether depend upon the stock of provision
in the hive. The commencement of the queen&rsquo;s
breeding may generally be known, by the bees carrying
in pellets of farina on their thighs. For want
of a sufficient supply of this, as must happen in
cold unkindly seasons, many of the nymphs are
cast out, having died probably from actual starvation.
Hence the necessity, as before stated, of
having in the immediate neighbourhood of the
hives such early blossoming trees and flowers as
afford plenty of farina; and also late blossoming
ones, that the bees may be enabled to lay in a store
of it, ready for spring.</p>

<p>Swarming may take place at any time between
the beginning of April and the latter end of August.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">- 119 -</a></span>
It seldom happens before ten in the morning,
nor later than three in the afternoon, and
never but in fine weather. If it be sultry, bees
are apt to rise after a storm, being anxious to
escape from the heat of the hive, rendered more
intolerable by the confinement which the storm
has occasioned. In the sixth volume of the Philosophical
Transactions, an instance is recorded by
<span class="smcap">Richard Reed</span>, Esq. of Lugwardine, of a swarm
issuing on the 9th of March; as he supposed, in
consequence of there being an insufficient supply
of food for the whole family, a part were sent forth
to seek their fortunes, lest the whole should perish.
The day, he says, was fine, but does not mention
the temperature. Probably this was a stock which
had bred in the month of February, the swarm
issuing from the usual cause, a disproportion
between the size of the family and the size of the
habitation.</p>

<p>If early swarming be desired, early breeding
must be promoted, by feeding with sugared or
honeyed ale in February and March, and by keeping
the stock warm. And if the apiarian at any time
wish to obtain a swarm, he has only to withhold
from his bees that accommodation which storifying
affords them.</p>

<p>The most advantageous time for a swarm to be
thrown off is from the middle of May to the middle
of June. This period comprehends the grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">- 120 -</a></span>
harvest season of the honeyed race. After the
scythe has cut down the flowers which adorn our
meadows and yield the bees such a plentiful supply
of honey and farina, there is a very manifest
relaxation in their activity; their excursions are
not only much less extensive, but less frequent,
although the weather be in all respects propitious.
Swarms that issue much earlier than the time I
have specified, are apt to be small; and should
bad weather succeed, feeding will be necessary, to
prevent famine. Those that issue later, afford no
better promise, either to themselves or to the
parent hives; for though late swarms are usually
large ones, they will scarcely have time to rear
their brood, and to lay in a store of honey, &amp;c.
adequate to the support of the family during the
ensuing winter and spring. Late swarming is not
only hazardous to the bees thrown off, but is injurious
to the parent stock, which suffers in proportion
to the loss of labourers, that should contribute
to the general store of food, and assist in
rearing the brood, which is generally abundant,
though the season be far advanced.</p>

<p>Hence it is the usual practice, early in the autumn,
to suffocate both the swarm and the stock,
in order to secure whatever wax and honey may
have been collected up to that time. There is
however another alternative, as will be seen under
the head of <i>Uniting Swarms or Stocks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">- 121 -</a></span></p>

<p>If several days of rainy weather should succeed
a swarm&rsquo;s going off, the stores they carry with
them from the parent hive may be exhausted and
endanger a famine; in such a case recourse must
be had to feeding.</p>

<p>First, an &#339;conomical division of labour, an advantage
common to all bodies of artificers, whose
works are conducted upon a large scale, and
which causes a larger quantity of wax and honey
to be collected in the season, than if the bees
were to swarm, and to carry on their operations
in separate families.</p>

<p>Secondly, the facility with which the bees may
be deprived of a considerable portion of their
honey, without destroying their lives, or communicating
to the honey any unpleasant flavour,
from the sulphurous gas.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the power which is afforded to the
bees, of employing themselves usefully during
wet weather, in the manner before stated.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the saving of that time which is unnecessarily
spent in the construction of fresh
combs, in the new habitation.</p>

<p>Fifthly, the saving of room; for as every family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">- 123 -</a></span>
has more warehouse-room than its respective necessities
require, the division into small families
must multiply the proportion of this superfluous
room.</p>

<p>Sixthly, the saving of the time usually lost in
preparation for swarming, when the bees hang
inactively in clusters, on the outsides of the hives,
for many days, sometimes for weeks, particularly
if the weather be unfavourable.</p>

<p>It seems right to remark in this place, that
though this <i>clustering</i> or <i>hanging out</i> of the bees
is generally regarded as one of the strongest
symptoms of an approaching swarm, it is nevertheless
a deceptive one. It does certainly indicate
that there are bees sufficient to throw off a
swarm, and is sometimes evidence of an anxiety
to do so; but unless there be a queen ready to go
off with them, however distrest for room, the
clustering will sometimes continue for a considerable
time; in hot dry seasons it may last till the
middle of August. This clustering, as before observed,
is very prejudicial, as it causes the bees
to be inactive in their principal harvest season,
when every bee ought to be fully employed, and
may induce a habit of inactivity for the future.
Clustering likewise obstructs the operations of the
bees that are active, by interrupting the thoroughfare
to the hive. These disadvantages are admirably
remedied by storifying, without which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">- 124 -</a></span>
independently of the loss of time to the bees, a
constant system of watchfulness must be kept up
by the proprietor, during the whole period of the
bees clustering out, otherwise a swarm may be
lost.</p>

<p>Storifying, though generally, is not invariably
successful in causing the clustered bees to reenter
the boxes: where it fails to do so, if a
young queen were ready to assume the sovereignty
of the colony, the clustered bees would
swarm and seek a new habitation with the old
one. M. Reaumur drowned several hives thus
circumstanced, and examined all their inmates
most minutely, but could never find more than a
single queen, and this the old one; in none of
these hives did he find royal larv&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keys</span> says that he has <i>failed to make the
clustered bees rejoin the family, if he has put the
empty him or box over the colony;</i> but that by
<i>placing the box under it, the bees soon re-entered
and worked vigorously</i>. I have myself, in several
instances, noticed the reluctance of bees to ascend;
this reluctance will however generally give way
in a day or two, if no room be allowed them in
any other direction. This is proved by the successful
use of small glasses upon flat-topped hives
or boxes, for obtaining fresh honey occasionally.
<span class="smcap">Thorley</span> <i>constantly practised super-hiving</i>, and
was very successful with it. So likewise is my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">- 125 -</a></span>
friend <span class="smcap">Mr. Walond</span>, who finds it afford him a
supply of purer honey than nadir-hiving; for as
the queen is generally found more disposed to
descend than to ascend, by placing the box over
the stock it will seldom be stored with any other
combs than those which contain honey. <span class="smcap">Mr.
George Hubbard</span>, however, of Bury St. Edmunds,
in a paper contained in the Transactions
of the Society of Arts, vol. ix. (for which they
awarded him ten guineas), says that he has
known instances in which the <i>bees have swarmed
rather than submit to super-hiving</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bees have been known to construct combs under
the floors of the hives, when restricted for room
within.</i> Here their natural activity surmounted
the impediments thrown in their way, by the
want of inclosed space. The storifying or colonizing
plan has been much applauded for its
saving the lives of the bees: though this preservation
be well worthy of attention, yet it is an
advantage very inferior to that which is derived
from the &#339;conomical division of labour, the consequent
increase of wax and honey, and the facility
afforded for extracting them. I trust that
this remark will not expose me to the imputation
of inhumanity, for I am fully sensible of the value
of life to all creatures that exist, and have often
felt strongly the force of Thomson&rsquo;s pathetic description
of the sulphurous death of bees.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">N</span>otwithstanding</span> what I have said in the last
chapter on the subject of clustering, it is too
important a circumstance to be omitted in the
following enumeration of the signs of swarming.</p>

<p>1. Clustering or hanging out, if taken singly,
may be regarded as a fallacious symptom, but
when conjoined with other indications, it may be
considered as a sign of swarming, particularly if
accompanied by the signs enumerated at the
commencement of my motto.</p>

<p>2. The drones being visible in greater numbers
than usual, and in great commotion, especially in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>3. The inactivity of the working bees, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">- 128 -</a></span>
neither gather honey nor farina, though the
morning be sunny and the weather altogether
inviting. Reaumur regarded this as the most
indubitable sign of preparation for swarming.</p>

<p>4. A singular humming noise, for two or three
nights previous, which has been variously described
and accounted for. It cannot always be
distinguished, unless the ear be placed near the
mouth of the hive; the sounds, which are sharp
and clear, seem to proceed from a single bee.
Some suppose the noise to be made by the young
queen, and to resemble <i>chip chip peep peep</i> or
the <i>toot toot</i> of a child&rsquo;s penny trumpet, but not
so loud; Mr. Hunter compares it to the lower a
in the treble of the piano-forte. It is readily
distinguishable by those who have been accustomed
to hear it. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> inquires, is it the
sound emitted by perfect queens, on emerging
from their cells, as described by M. Huber?
The noise is sometimes in a shrill, at other times
in a deeper key; this difference in the intensity
of the tones may arise from the distance whence
the sound proceeds, or may be intended to
intimate to the bees the respective ripeness of
their queens. <span class="smcap">Butler</span> and <span class="smcap">Woolridge</span> ascribe
it to a parley between the old and young queens,
the latter at the bottom of the hive requesting
leave to emigrate, and the former answering in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">- 129 -</a></span>
her bass note from the top. <span class="smcap">Wildman</span> supposes
it to arise from a contest betwixt the queens,
about sallying forth; and endeavours to account
for its less frequency before first swarms, from
the young chiefs being then in their embryo
state. This however is mere hypothesis, and
not at all consonant with later discoveries, particularly
those of Huber and Dunbar. <i>Vide</i>
pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a> and <a href="#Page_22">22</a>.</p>

<p>5. Unusual silence in the hive, during which
the separatists are supposed to be taking in a
cargo of honey before their flight, as a provision
against bad weather. Mr. Hunter opened the
crops of some bees that remained in the parent
hive and the crops of some emigrating bees,
when he found the latter quite full, whilst the
former contained but a small quantity.</p>

<p><i>The above symptoms oftener precede second or
third than first swarms, which latter sometimes
issue forth without any previous notice.</i> <span class="smcap">Keys</span>
speaks so emphatically upon this subject that I
shall quote his words. &ldquo;Although there are no
signs that precede first swarms, those, before-mentioned,
convey to the apiator one certain
meaning, and when heard he may be assured
that the first or prime swarm has escaped, if
that will comfort him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment before their departure exhibits a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">- 130 -</a></span>
very lively agitation, which first affects the queen,
and is then communicated to the workers, exciting
such a tumult among them, that they
abandon their labours, and rush in disorder to
the outlets.</p>

<p>If a swarm quit the first place on which it
clusters, it hovers in the air for some time, as if
undetermined, and then flies off with great velocity.</p>

<p>We hear now and then of a swarm of bees
being lost, of its having eluded the vigilance of
the proprietor; I think that its loss is generally
attributable to negligence. As a different opinion
is prevalent, I shall state a few of the facts upon
which that difference is founded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Homer</span> and <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> speak of bees in their wild
state as fixing their habitations in the rocks and
in hollow trees.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Clustering in heaps on heaps, the driving bees.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Pope&rsquo;s Homer.</span></p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And oft, (&rsquo;tis said,) they delve beneath the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And nurse in gloomy caves their hidden birth,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Or hang in hollow trees their airy cell.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Sotheby&rsquo;s Georgics.</span></p></div>

<p>Many instances are also recorded of domesticated
bees seeking an asylum in some hollow part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">- 131 -</a></span>
of an old building or tree. <span class="smcap">Dr. Warder</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Butler</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>, <span class="smcap">M. Duchet</span>,
and other writers think that the bees about to
swarm regularly send out scouts, to explore an
eligible situation for their future residence;
though Dr. Evans admits that this disposition to
resume wild habits, like many of the instinctive
faculties of the animal creation, has its intensity
weakened by domestication. Dr. Warder asserts
that the bees always send out providers, to select
a suitable residence for them, several days before
swarming, and considers that their clustering
upon a bough, &amp;c. soon after they issue forth,
proceeds from their desire to be all congregated
together prior to the last flight: this is likewise
the opinion of Mr. Knight. If the place selected
be a deserted hive, it is first cleared by the bees
of all heterogeneous matters, the old combs alone
being allowed to remain. An observance of this
conduct probably led <span class="smcap">Columella</span> to recommend
the placing of empty hives, during the swarming
season, in appropriate situations near an apiary.
<span class="smcap">Keys</span> gives a similar recommendation. <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>
on the other hand ridicules the idea of &ldquo;spies
and quartermasters,&rdquo; as ingenious fable. What
I have stated in Chapter <span class="smcap">XVII</span>. <a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>. confirms
Reaumur&rsquo;s opinion: he is also supported in it by
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>, <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span>, and <span class="smcap">Huber</span>: the former says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">- 132 -</a></span>
that the swarming bees form a cloud round their
queen, and set off without seeming to know the
place of their destination;&mdash;&ldquo;the world before
them, where to choose their place of rest.&rdquo; I will
however detail a few cases that support the theory
of &ldquo;spies and quartermasters.&rdquo; In the Philosophical
Transactions for 1807, <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span>, writing to
Sir Joseph Banks, relates several instances of the
kind. On one occasion he observed from twenty
to thirty bees paying daily visits to some decayed
trees, about a mile distant from his garden; the
bees appeared to be busily employed in examining
the hollow parts, and particularly the
dead knots around them, as if apprehensive of
the knots admitting moisture. In about fourteen
days, these seeming surveyors were followed by
a large swarm from his apiary, which was
watched the whole way, till it alighted in one of
these cavities. It was observed to journey nearly
in a direct line from the apiary to the tree. On
several similar occasions the bees selected that
cavity which Mr. Knight thought best adapted
to their use. He has also noticed that, a stock
being nearly ready to swarm, one of these hollow
trees was daily occupied by a small number of
bees; but the swarm from that stock, being
lodged in another <i>hive</i>, the tree was wholly deserted.
This preference of a <i>hive</i>, when offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">- 133 -</a></span>
them, to a place chosen by themselves, Mr.
Knight ascribes to a habit acquired by domestication,
which generating a dependence upon man
for providing them a dwelling, descends hereditarily
from the parents to their offspring.
Another instance is related by <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>: he
suffered a hive, whose tenants had died in the
winter, to remain upon the stand till spring: he
then observed several bees paying it daily visits,
and busily employed within, but leaving it at the
close of evening. These soon appeared, like
Dr. Warder&rsquo;s providers, to be the harbingers of
a swarm; for, early in June, an immense body
of these insects were seen rapidly approaching,
and then surrounding the hive: they took possession
as quickly as its narrow entrance and
crowded combs would permit. The same result
was noticed after the mild winter of 1806-7,
which untenanted one of his hives by famine:
he was present when the swarm issued (from
another hive in his garden) to take possession of
the empty one, which, on his endeavouring to
raise it, to give facility to their entrance, he
found already cemented to the floor. The Doctor
also relates a case in which a swarm of bees
"made its way either over the tops of some very
high houses, or through several winding streets,
to an old house in the centre of Shrewsbury, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">- 134 -</a></span>
passing through an aperture in the wood-work to
a room on the first floor, were there hived by the
family." <span class="smcap">Mr. Butler</span> in his <i>Feminine Monarchie</i>
mentions the case of a poor woman whose hive
being depopulated by famine was allowed to
remain out of doors till the ensuing summer,
when a swarm took possession of it, from which
she afterwards stored her garden. Other instances
of a similar kind have been related; but
in most of them it is not easy to ascertain how
far the proprietors of the hives, from which the
swarms went forth, had been improvident. The
cases related by Mr. Knight are the most remarkable;
but with respect to these, further information
would be desirable. Was there any
inducement beyond a snug housing in the cavities
of the trees, to tempt the bees to wander so far
from their native spot? such as favourite pasturage,
or neighbouring trees that were wont to
supply honey-dew? or were there in either of
the hollow trees, thus occupied, any old combs
which had been left there by another family?
Lastly, were the emigrating bees exposed to any
annoyance in their old habitation, either from
neighbours of their own species or the attacks
of other animals? or were they deprived of any
sheltering protection to which they had been
accustomed, by the removal of buildings, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">- 135 -</a></span>
cutting down of trees or otherwise? <span class="smcap">Bonner</span>,
who agrees in opinion with Mr. Knight, that
bees often go in quest of a suitable habitation,
before they swarm, has observed that he knew
for certain that a swarm would not fly a mile to
an empty hive, &ldquo;whereas they will fly,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;four miles to take possession of an old one with
combs in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption2">HIVING OF SWARMS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> hiving of bees is a proceeding so well known
that it seems unnecessary to offer any observations
on the particular method of effecting it.</p>

<p>In every apiary there should be a stock of hives,
boxes, &amp;c. always ready before-hand, either for
storifying or for single-hiving; a neglect of this
precaution will often be productive of great inconvenience
and confusion.</p>

<p>It is always desirable to <i>have swarms put into
new hives</i>, as old ones often contain the larv&aelig; of
moths and other embryo insects, which may prove
injurious to the bees. If straw be the material
with which they are made, every rough straw
should be removed from the interior, otherwise
the bees will lose that time in rendering it smooth,
which they could employ to greater advantage in
gathering honey and constructing combs. For a
similar reason, if boxes be preferred, these should
be made air-tight with putty or other cement, that
the bees may not consume their time in filling the
crevices with propolis. If on any occasion the
apiarian be induced to have recourse to <i>an old
hive</i>, for receiving a swarm, it <i>should, before being
used, be dipped into boiling water</i>, to destroy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">- 137 -</a></span>
eggs of moths and other insects, after which it
should be made perfectly dry.</p>

<p>In the common straw-hive, two new sticks
placed across each other, at the second round of
straw from the bottom, will be useful to support
the weight of combs: the bees require no aid at
the top, to which they will themselves securely
attach the combs, as may be seen in hollow trees
where bees have taken up their abode.</p>

<p><i>Dressing the insides of the hives</i> is of doubtful
advantage. Some people rub the interior of the
hive with balm, bean-tops, fennel, &amp;c. or smear
it over with cream and honey. Wildman strongly
reprobates this practice, as it gives the bees the
trouble of making the hive clean again. If any
thing be used, in compliance with custom, sugared
or honeyed ale is the most alluring. <span class="smcap">Keys</span> says
that a hive, containing old combs and dressed
with sugared ale, will often decoy a swarm to
settle in it. <span class="smcap">Huish</span> recommends sprinkling the
interior of the hives with human urine; which he
regards as a specific, on account of &ldquo;its <i>abounding</i>
with <i>sugar</i> and <i>salt</i>, two substances of which
bees are particularly fond:&rdquo; if such were the fact,
it would I think, be more cleanly, and therefore
a preferable plan, to mingle those favourite articles
with a little ale or water for this purpose. Huish
himself recommends smearing the interior of the
hive with honey, when a swarm of bees settle in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">- 138 -</a></span>
a situation, from which it cannot be dislodged and
made to enter the hive, by shaking or other forcible
means. If urine be attractive to bees, its
attraction must proceed from other qualities than
those which he has mentioned; it does certainly
contain a <i>very small portion</i> of <i>salt</i>, but I know of
no analysis of healthy human urine, which admits
sugar to be a constituent part of it.</p>

<p>A tinkling noise is generally, though I believe
erroneously, considered to be useful in inducing
bees to settle. <span class="smcap">Keys</span> recommends the use of a
watchman&rsquo;s rattle, but not till the queen has come
forth, for fear of alarming her too soon, nor after
the bees have begun to cluster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keys</span> advises also the throwing of sand or water
among the bees, to make them cluster; likewise
the making of some <i>very</i> great noise, such as firing
a gun; some have supposed the bees to mistake
a loud noise, for thunder foreboding a storm; but
this, instead of causing them to settle, would rather
cause their return to the parent stock. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>
suggests the probability of noises being first used,
as signals to the neighbours that a swarm was up,
and being afterwards continued by habit only.
The throwing up of handfuls of dust or sand, is
said to make bees descend, when they soar very
high; these missiles being mistaken for rain.</p>

<p><i>Bees, when swarming, are generally peaceable</i>,
and if treated gently, may be hived without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">- 139 -</a></span>
danger or difficulty. <i>A remarkable instance of
their inoffensiveness at this time</i> is related by <span class="smcap">Mr.
Thorley</span>. Wanting to dislodge a swarm from
the branches of a codlin-tree, he placed the hive
in the hands of his maid-servant, who being a
novice, covered her head and shoulders with a
cloth, to guard her face; on shaking the tree,
most of the bees alighted upon the cloth, and
quickly crept under it, covering the girl&rsquo;s breast
and neck up to her very chin. Mr. T. impressed
her with the importance of neither flinching from
nor buffeting the bees, and began immediately to
search for the queen; which on finding, he gently
seized and removed, but without effecting a dislodgement
of the swarm: thus disappointed, he
suspected that there was a second queen; which
actually proved to be the case: on securing, and
placing her also in the hive, with a portion of the
bees, the rest followed in multitudes, till in two
or three minutes not one bee remained upon the
girl, who was thus released from her state of apprehension
and alarm, without feeling the point
of a single sting. All persons similarly situated
may not be so fortunate, as, notwithstanding the
greatest precaution, bees may be provoked to
draw their swords. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> relates a case of
this kind; a swarm having settled on the branch
of a larch-tree, and its long tufts of narrow leaves
flapping the bees as the bough was shaken, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">- 140 -</a></span>
woman who hived them, received above thirty
stings. If the weather be windy, at the time of
swarming, they are often irritable, and apt to
sting; though clustered, they will frequently return
home: this last occurrence is generally
caused by the absence of a queen; but it may
also be produced by a sudden shower, or by the
transit of a dark cloud.</p>

<p>A queen has sometimes a defect in her wings,
or is disabled by some accident; either of these
misfortunes may cause the return of a swarm, or
produce symptoms of discontent after hiving.</p>

<p>As many persons doubt <i>the queen&rsquo;s importance</i>
to the harmonious union of a swarm, I shall give
an instance or two, to show how essentially necessary
her presence is to produce this effect. <span class="smcap">Dr.
Warder</span> being desirous of ascertaining the extent
of the bees&rsquo; &ldquo;loyalty to their sovereign, ran the
hazard of destroying a swarm, for this purpose.&rdquo;
Having shaken on the grass, all the bees from a
hive which they had only tenanted the day before,
he searched for the queen, by stirring amongst
them with a stick. Having found and placed her,
with a few attendants, in a box, she was taken
into his parlour; where the box being opened, she
and her attendants immediately flew to the window,
when he clipped off one of her wings, returned
her to the box, and confined her there for above
an hour. In less than a quarter of an hour, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">- 141 -</a></span>
swarm ascertained the loss of their queen, and
instead of clustering together in one social mass,
they diffused themselves over a space of several
feet, were much agitated, and uttered a piteous
sound. An hour afterwards they all took flight,
and settled upon the hedge where they had first
alighted, after leaving the parent stock; but instead
of hanging together, like a bunch of grapes,
as when the queen was with them, and as swarms
usually hang, they extended themselves thirty
feet along the hedge, in small bunches, of forty,
fifty, or more. The queen was now presented to
them, when they all quickly gathered round her,
with a joyful hum, and formed one harmonious
cluster. At night the Doctor hived them again,
and on the following morning repeated his experiment,
to see whether the bees would rise; the
queen being in a mutilated state, and unable to
accompany them, they surrounded her for several
hours, apparently willing to die with her rather
than desert her in distress. The queen was a
second time removed, when they spread themselves
out again, as though starching for her: her
repeated restoration to them, at different parts of
their circle, produced one uniform result, &ldquo;and
these poor loyal and loving creatures, always
marched and counter-marched every way as the
queen was laid.&rdquo; The Doctor persevered in these
experiments, till after five days and nights of fasting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">- 142 -</a></span>
they all died of famine, except the queen,
who lived a few hours longer and then died. <i>The
attachment of the queen to the working bees</i>, appeared
to be equally as strong as their attachment
to her; though offered honey on several occasions,
during the periods of her separation from
them, she constantly refused it, &ldquo;disdaining a
life that was no life to her, without the company
of those which she could not have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My next instance is contained in the <i>Transactions
of the Society of Arts, &amp;c.</i> for 1790, in a
paper written by <span class="smcap">Mr. Simon Manley</span>, of Topsham
in Devonshire, for which the Society awarded him
five guineas. &ldquo;I have before now,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;taken the queen-bee, while in the act of swarming,
put her into a clean bottle, and kept her from
the swarm a full hour. I have then shown her to
several gentlemen, the swarm continuing to hover,
without settling, the whole time. I brought her
home, and laid her on the floor of a kitchen
window. Being moist with her own breath in the
bottle, when I took her out she licked herself
clean, and being quite recovered, was carried out
and placed upon the hive she swarmed from.
About a handful of her subjects soon found her
out, and seemed much rejoiced at finding her.
From thence she rose up, and pitched upon a
currant bush, and the remainder of the swarm
came to her, and settled at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">- 143 -</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span> tried the experiment of fastening
the queen by one of her legs to the end of a
pole, by which he induced the bees to follow him
wherever he chose. Reaumur relates a somewhat
similar instance of a bee-man mentioned by
<span class="smcap">Father Labbat</span> in his Travels, who had the address
to conceal the source of his dexterity. <span class="smcap">Wildman&rsquo;s</span>
expertness in this way was celebrated far
and near. <i>Vide</i> chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Uniting Swarms</a>.</p>

<p>In confirmation of the evidence I have already
given, of the queen&rsquo;s importance to the well-being
of the community, I will advert to some experiments
of <span class="smcap">Huber</span>. He removed a queen from one
of his hives; the bees were not immediately
aware of it, but continued their labours, watched
over the young, and performed the whole of their
ordinary occupations. In a few hours afterwards,
agitation commenced, and all appeared to be a
scene of tumult; a singular humming noise was
heard, the bees deserted their young and rushed
over the surface of the combs, with delirious impetuosity.
On replacing the queen, tranquillity
was instantly restored; and from what will be said
presently, it appeared that they knew her individual
person. Huber varied this experiment
with other hives, in different ways; instead of
restoring their own queen, he tried to substitute
<i>a stranger queen</i>; the manner of her reception
depended upon the period at which she was introduced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">- 144 -</a></span>
If twenty-four hours had elapsed after
the removal of the queen, the stranger was well
received, and at once admitted to the sovereignty
of the hive. If not more than eighteen hours had
elapsed, she was at first treated as a prisoner, but
after a time permitted to reign. If the stranger
was introduced within twelve hours, she was immediately
surrounded by an impenetrable cluster
of bees, and commonly died either from hunger
or privation of air. It appeared therefore, in the
course of these experiments, that from twenty-four
to thirty hours were required, for a colony
to forget its sovereign, and that if, before the
lapse of that period, no substitute was presented,
they set about constructing royal cells, as stated
in <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>; and moreover, that if, during the
time they were so occupied, a princess was
brought to them, the fabrication of royal cells
was instantly abandoned, and the larv&aelig; selected
to occupy them were destroyed. On the admission
of a welcome stranger queen, more regard is
perhaps shown to her at first, than to a restored
natural queen,&mdash;at least there are more conspicuous
demonstrations of it: the nearest workers touch
her with their antenn&aelig;, and, passing their proboscis
over every part of her body, give her
honey. In the cases above related, the bees all
vibrated their wings at once, as if experiencing
some agreeable sensations, and ranged themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">- 145 -</a></span>
in a circle round her. Others, in succession,
broke through this circle, and having repeated
the same process, of touching her with their antenn&aelig;,
giving her honey, &amp;c. formed themselves
in a circle behind the others, vibrating their wings
and keeping up a pleasurable hum. These demonstrations
were continued for a quarter of an
hour, when the queen beginning to move towards
one part of the circle, an opening was made
through which she passed, followed and surrounded
by her customary guard. Such is the
substance of Huber&rsquo;s account: it does not entirely
correspond with what has been stated by
Dunbar. <i>Vide</i> chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Bee-boxes</a>.</p>

<p>The loyal <i>attachment of bees to their queen</i> extends
even beyond this: <span class="smcap">Huber</span> states that he
has seen the workers, &ldquo;after her death, treat her
body as they treated herself when alive, and long
prefer this inanimate body to the most fertile
queens he had offered them.&rdquo; And <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>
relates a case, in which a queen was observed to
lie on some honey-comb in a thinly peopled hive,
apparently dying, and surrounded by six bees,
with their faces turned towards her, quivering
their wings, and most of them with their stings
pointed, as if to keep off any assailant. On presenting
them honey, though it was eagerly devoured
by the other bees, the guards were so
completely absorbed in the care of their queen, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">- 146 -</a></span>
entirely to disregard it. The following day,
though dead, she was still guarded; and though
the bees were still constantly supplied with honey,
their numbers were gradually diminished by
death, till, at the end of three or four days, not
a bee remained alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wildman</span> says that if the queen of a swarm be
lost, though it happen several weeks after leaving
the mother hive, the bees will return to it, carrying
their honey with them. This, if true, must
occur where no grub can be converted into a
queen. Both <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> and <span class="smcap">Wildman</span> tried the
experiment of introducing a royal larva into a
queenless stock, when the bees immediately set
to work again, on the inspiration of hope alone.</p>

<p>Should symptoms of discontent be observed
after hiving, the queen will probably be discovered
on the ground, or somewhere apart;
surrounded by a small cluster of attendants, whom
nothing but violence can separate from her. If
she be taken up either singly or with the cluster,
and placed near the entrance of the hive containing
the swarm, all will be harmony.</p>

<p><i>Sometimes a swarm divides into two portions</i>,
which settle apart from each other and have each
a distinct leader. The conduct of the apiarian
must be governed by the size of the two divisions,
and the season at which they emerge; unless both
be large and the swarming early, they had better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">- 147 -</a></span>
be hived in separate boxes, and joined together,
in the manner recommended in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chap. XIX</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columella</span> was the first who proposed union
by killing the supernumerary queen.</p>

<p>The branch on which the swarm settled is
sometimes rubbed with wormwood, or smoked
with disagreeable fumes, to drive away all remaining
loiterers.</p>

<p>In every operation, it is desirable to avoid
crushing a single bee, as, in case of discovery,
the rest are excited to anger. See chapter on the
<i>Senses of Bees</i>.</p>

<p>Immediately on the bees taking to the hive, it
should be placed upon a table, on a proper floor
board, and be covered with boughs or a cloth;
and the hive should be near the parent stock, to
catch stragglers, on their return home. At night
it should be removed to its permanent station.</p>

<p class="caption2">ON REMOVING BEES FROM COMMON
STRAW-HIVES TO STORIFYING HIVES
OR BOXES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">M</span>any</span> plans have been suggested for transferring
bees from hives to boxes; but excepting in the
case of a recent swarm, I would not recommend
any, but an experienced apiarian, to attempt an
immediate transfer.</p>

<p>In the case of a recent swarm, the method of
effecting the object is simple and easy; for if, when
the bees have retired for the night, the hive be
placed upon a middle board, with a divider underneath
it, and the whole be inverted upon a small
tub or a peck measure, and an empty box be
raised upon the divider, this latter being withdrawn,
and every opening besides what is necessary
for admitting air being well secured, the bees
will all probably have ascended into the box by
morning, when with the assistance of the dividers
they may be placed in the bee-house or any where
else that the proprietor chooses, just as if they had
been originally hived in the box. If the ascent
have not taken place in the morning, it may be
effected by drumming smartly with two sticks,
upon the sides of the hive: in this way, the ascent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">- 149 -</a></span>
may be known by the loud humming noise by
which it will be accompanied.</p>

<p>I have said that the above plan is only to be
recommended in cases of recent swarming: by this
I mean, in swarms of the day on which it is attempted,
and before any works are constructed in
the hives, to such an extent as to make the bees
tenacious of their new habitation; for wherever
they form a settlement, though even for the short
time that they occupy a bush or tree before
hiving, there are always to be seen the rudiments
of one or more combs, showing, that they always
intend, (so far as one can give bees credit for
intention,) to take up their abode, permanently,
upon the very spot on which they first cluster
round their Royal Leader.</p>

<p>If however, from want of forethought or from
any other causes, a swarm have been allowed, for
a longer period, to occupy a hive from which it is
desirable to dislodge it, in that case I would recommend
the apiarian, towards night, to place the
hive upon a middle board with a divider underneath
it, to lute the junction with clay, so as to
prevent the bees from escaping, and to invert the
whole upon a stool that has had an opening made
in it of sufficient size to allow the hive to sink
about half-way through it. Then, if he raise a
couple of empty boxes upon the divider, in the
manner already directed for super-hiving, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">- 150 -</a></span>
having adjusted the whole, withdraw the divider,
the bees will soon desist from carrying on their
works in the hive, and commence new ones in the
upper box; the hive at the period of deprivation
may be separated from the boxes in the usual
way.</p>

<p>The middle board that is used on this occasion,
provided the colony be designed to stand out of
doors, must have a resting board attached to the
edge of it, for the bees to alight upon. And as it
is intended to serve as a substitute for a floor
board, it must be made to correspond with the
floor boards in its construction, so far as respects
its giving liberty for the bees to have ingress and
egress, and its affording a power to shut them in.</p>

<p>If it should be thought more convenient, an
entrance could readily be formed, by cutting a
piece out of the lower edge of the box, in which
also a groove might be cut for a slide to run in.</p>

<p class="caption2">SUPER- AND NADIR-HIVING BY MEANS OF DIVIDERS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">W</span>hen</span> one hive or box is to be raised upon another
in a bee-house, the operation may be performed
at any time; the best time is about ten or eleven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when a great portion of
the bees are ranging the fields. If the bees be
kept in an out-door hive, the operation will be
best performed in an evening or early in a morning,
when, all the bees being at home, they may
be shut in and thereby prevented from annoying
the operator.</p>

<p>If <i>super-hiving</i> be the object of the apiarian, he
must first withdraw the four screws out of the top
board of his stock-hive or box, so as to enable
him to push one of his dividers from front to back,
between that board and the box which it covers;
he may then safely take off the top, and screw it
upon an empty box. (He would of course be enabled
to accomplish the business with more
promptitude, if he have a supernumerary top
already screwed down.) Having put the fresh box
upon a middle board, the whole is to be carefully
placed upon the divider, that covers the stock:
when accurately adjusted to each other, if an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">- 152 -</a></span>
assistant hold firmly in their places the two boxes,
or the inferior box and the middle board, the divider
may be withdrawn, and thus a communication
between the two boxes will immediately be
effected, without the escape, and perhaps without
the destruction, of a single bee.</p>

<p>When I have had no assistant near me, upon
whose steadiness I could rely, at the time of withdrawing
the divider, I have fixed a piece of double
quarter with one of its ends against the inferior
box, and the other against the wall opposite to it,
and have thus effectually prevented the box from
moving, whilst with one hand I held firmly the
middle board, and drew out the divider with the
other. My readers are to suppose me operating
in a bee-house, for in an out-door apiary an assistant
will always be required, whenever any important
operation is to be performed.</p>

<p><i>Nadir-hiving</i> is accomplished by introducing
both dividers between the floor board and the box
or hive which it supports, the first with its turned
edge downwards, and the other upon it with its
turned edge upwards. The box or boxes are
then to be removed on one side or upon a table,
together with the upper plate or divider, which
will form a temporary floor to the box, while the
lower plate covers the wooden floor and those few
bees that may be lodged upon it.</p>

<p>In removing the box or boxes for nadir-hiving,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">- 153 -</a></span>
some caution is requisite, to prevent the escape
of the bees. The safest plan is gradually to draw
forward the boxes with their temporary floor, till
they hang nearly half over the wooden floor, and
then, by spreading out the fingers and applying
them under each side of the divider, the whole
may be lifted up and moved wherever it be most
convenient till raised upon the nadir. When the
box has been drawn half off, a weight should be
placed upon the covering divider, to prevent it
from tilting up.</p>

<p>The removal being accomplished, an empty box
should be quickly placed upon the divider which
covers the floor, and upon the box a middle board;
the adjustment being complete, the dividers are
to be withdrawn separately, and with the same
precautions as in super-hiving.</p>

<p>If the apiarian wish to practise <i>centre-hiving</i>
<i>i. e.</i> to introduce an empty box between a superior
and an inferior one, he can easily apply the preceding
directions to that particular case.</p>

<p class="caption2">UNITING SWARMS OR STOCKS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> union of swarms with their stocks, and of
swarms or stocks with each other, in case of their
being or becoming weak, has been attempted in
various ways, and with various success, depending
perhaps, in some degree, upon the skill and
adroitness of the operator. Upon the storifying
plan this operation will rarely be necessary, excepting
in the case of weak stocks, as it is not
a very common occurrence for storified bees to
swarm, and when they do so, they generally throw
off strong swarms. Still the object may occasionally
be desirable, and it is worthy of attention, for
<i>the tenants of well filled hives are always the most
active</i>.</p>

<p>The three usual methods by which union has
been attempted, and indeed their advocates say,
accomplished, are <i>fuming them, immersing them in
water</i>, and <i>aspersing them with sugared or honeyed
ale</i>. To these I may add a fourth, namely <i>operating
upon their fears</i>, by confining them for a
time, and then alarming them by drumming
smartly upon the outside of their domicile. It
was operating on their fears that enabled Wildman
to perform such extraordinary feats with bees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">- 155 -</a></span>
When under a strong impression of fear, says he,
they are rendered subservient to our wills, to such
a degree as to remain long attached to any place
they afterwards settle upon, and will become so
mild and tractable, as to bear any handling which
does not hurt them, without the least show of
resentment. &ldquo;Long experience has taught me,
that as soon as I turn up a hive, and give some
taps on the sides and bottom, the queen immediately
appears.&rdquo; &ldquo;Being accustomed to see her,
I readily perceive her at the first glance; and
long practice has enabled me to seize her instantly,
with a tenderness that does not in the least endanger
her person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Being possessed of her, I
can, without exciting any resentment, slip her
into my other hand, and returning the hive to its
place, hold her, till the bees missing her, are all
on the wing, and in the utmost confusion.&rdquo; When
in this state, he could make them alight wherever
he pleased; for on whatever spot he placed the
queen, the moment a few of them discovered her,
the information was rapidly communicated to the
rest, who in a few minutes were all collected round
her. In this way he would sometimes cause them
to settle on his head, or to hang clustered from
his chin, in which state they somewhat resembled
a beard. Again he would transfer them to his
hand, or to any other part of his body, or if more
agreeable to the spectators before whom he exhibited,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">- 156 -</a></span>
he would cause them to settle upon a
table, window, &amp;c. Prior to making his secret
generally known, he deceived his spectators by
using words of command; but the only magic that
he employed was the summoning into activity for
his purpose the strong attachment of the bees to
their queen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Such was the spell, which round a Wildman&rsquo;s arm<br /></span>

<p>Cautioning his readers as to the hazard of attempting,
what he himself accomplished only by long
experience and great dexterity, Wildman concludes
his account with a parody of the reply of
C. Furius Cresinus, a liberated Roman slave, who,
being accused of witchcraft in consequence of his
raising more abundant crops than his neighbours,
and therefore cited before a Roman tribunal, produced
his strong implements of husbandry, his
well-fed oxen, and a hale young woman his daughter;
and pointing to them, said, &ldquo;<i>These, Romans!
are my instruments of witchcraft; but I cannot
show you my toil, my sweats, and anxious cares.</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; says Wildman, &ldquo;may I say, <i>These, Britons!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">- 157 -</a></span>
are my instruments of witchcraft; but I cannot show
you my hours of attention to this subject, my anxiety
and care for these useful insects; nor can I communicate
to you my experience, acquired during a
course of years</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The neatest and most scientific mode</i> with which
I am acquainted <i>of uniting weak families together
in harmony</i> was invented by my friend The <span class="smcap">Rev.
Richard Walond</span>, whom I had occasion to mention
in a former chapter, and whose experience
in the management of bees, for nearly half a century,
entitle his opinions concerning them to great
respect. His theory and practice upon this subject
are as follow. Bees, says he, emit a peculiar
odour, and it is by no means improbable that every
family of bees emits an odour peculiar to itself:
if so, as their vision seems to be imperfect, and
their smell acute, it may be by this distinctive
and peculiar odour that they are enabled to discriminate
betwixt the individuals of their own
family and those of a stranger hive. Upon this
supposition, if the odours of two separate stocks
or swarms can be so blended as to make them
completely merge into each other, there will then
probably be no difficulty in effecting the union of
any two families that it may be desirable to unite.
To accomplish this end therefore, Mr. Walond
had recourse to a very ingenious contrivance: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">- 158 -</a></span>
procured a plate of tin, the size of a divider, and
thickly perforated with holes, about the size of
those in a coarse nutmeg-grater. Having confined
in their respective hives or boxes, the two families
to be united, and placed them over each other,
with only a divider between them; he introduced
his perforated tin plate upon the divider, which
was then withdrawn. Immediately the bees began
to cluster with hostile intentions, one family clinging
to the upper, the other to the under side of the
perforated plate; when after remaining in this state
for about twenty-four hours, they had so far communicated
to each other their respective effluvia,
and so completely commixed were the odours in
both hives, that on withdrawing the perforated
plate, the bees mingled together as one family, no
disturbance being excited, but such as arose from
the presence of two queens, the custom being
always, in such case, to dethrone one of them.
According to Huber this is effected by single combat
between the queens: which subject will be
adverted to in a future chapter. <span class="smcap">Keys</span> has observed
that <i>these incorporations seldom turn to account
unless they be effected in summer</i>; and when
it is considered that the principal gathering months
are May and June, (excepting in those neighbourhoods
that abound in lime, sycamore, and other
trees that are apt to be affected with honey-dew,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">- 159 -</a></span>
we cannot, of course, expect them to be very successful.
I have entered fully into this subject, when
speaking of early and late swarms, <a href="#Page_115">page 115</a>.</p>

<p>To obviate the consequences there apprehended,
some apiarians have had recourse to the practice
of removing their bees to fresh pasture; to districts
where buckwheat is cultivated, or to the
neighbourhood of heaths, or to any other place
where such late blossoming flowers abound as
afford honey. Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaac</span> assures us that he
once had a poor swarm of a month&rsquo;s standing,
which only weighed five pounds four ounces, and
that on the 30th of July he had it removed to
<i>Dartmoor Heath</i>, from whence it was brought
home, two months afterwards, increased in weight
twenty-four pounds and a half. He moreover
states that the increase of others, that were sent
there, was nearly proportional, and is of opinion
that the whole addition was made during the
month of August.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Lower Egypt</span>, where the flower harvest is
not so early as in the upper districts of that
country, this practice of <i>transportation</i> is carried
on to a considerable extent. The hives after
being collected together from the different villages,
and conveyed up the Nile marked and numbered
by the individuals to whom they belong, are heaped
pyramidally upon the boats prepared to receive
them, which floating gradually down the river and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">- 160 -</a></span>
stopping at certain stages of their passage, remain
there a longer or shorter time, according to the
produce which is afforded by the surrounding
country. &ldquo;After traveling three months in this
manner, the bees, having culled the perfumes of
the orange flowers of the Said, the essence of roses<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
of the Faicum, the treasures of the Arabian jessamine,
and a variety of flowers, are brought back
to the places from which they had been carried.
This industry procures, for the Egyptians, delicious
honey, and abundance of bees-wax. The
proprietors, in return, pay the boatmen a recompence
proportioned to the number of hives which
have been thus carried about from one extremity
of Egypt to the other.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Latreille</span> states that
between Cairo and Damietta a convoy of 4000
hives were seen upon the Nile by <span class="smcap">Niebuhr</span>, on
their transit from the upper to the lower districts
of that country. Floating bee-hives were formerly
common also in <span class="smcap">France</span>. One barge was capable
of containing from 60 to 100 hives, which, floating
gently down their rivers, enabled the bees to
gather the honey which is afforded by the flowers
on their banks. <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> likewise states it to
have been the practice in some districts to transport
them with similar views, by land, in vehicles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">- 161 -</a></span>
contrived for the purpose. In <span class="smcap">Savoy</span>, <span class="smcap">Piedmont</span>,
and other parts of <span class="smcap">Italy</span>, the practice is also common.
It is indeed of very ancient origin. Columella
speaks of it as a very general custom among
the Greeks, who used annually to send their bee-hives
from Achaia into Attica.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> Whatever inducement the bees of Egypt may have to

<p>These, however, are advantages which very few
situations can afford; probably but few of my
readers may reside in the neighbourhood of heaths,
and still fewer may be disposed to incur the trouble
and expense of removal. If therefore incorporation
be desirable in any particular case, I can
only recommend that attention be paid to feeding
the bees with sugared ale; by the assistance of
which, indeed, I should not be afraid of carrying,
even a weak stock, very safely through the winter
and early spring. &ldquo;Give your bees,&rdquo; says Mr.
Isaac, &ldquo;two harvests in one summer&rdquo; (alluding to
the practice of transportation), &ldquo;and you may
make almost any swarm rich enough to live
through the following winter.&rdquo; This second
harvest may be very efficiently supplied by an attention
to feeding, during mild weather in winter,
and particularly in the early spring,&mdash;for the management
of which, see, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">Chap. XXIII.</a> on Feeding.</p>

<p class="caption2">PROPER PERIODS OF DEPRIVATION.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">I</span>t</span> should be an invariable rule with the apiarian,
never to remove an upper hive or box, till an
under one be quite full; and even then, it should
be ascertained that the contents of the inferior
one, (if taken at Michaelmas,) be not less than
18 pounds. If it do not contain so much, a
sufficient quantity should be returned in the box
that has been removed, otherwise recourse must
be had to feeding. <span class="smcap">Mr. Isaac</span> says that he has
carried a colony that had no honey at Michaelmas,
safely through the winter and spring, with
only eight pounds of honey. Huber succeeded
with less; but it appears that his observations
were made upon weak stocks that were not
altogether destitute.</p>

<p>A variety of experiments were made by <span class="smcap">Mr.
John Hunter</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr. Keys</span>, to ascertain <i>the
quantity consumed during</i> the respective months
of <i>winter and spring</i>, and they all led to one conclusion,
namely, that it <i>amounted upon an average
to eight pounds</i>, taking the season through, from
the beginning of October to the end of May,
when the spring proves ungenial. <i>During the
first six months the consumption was not more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">- 163 -</a></span>
than five pounds upon an average</i>, and the colder
the weather the smaller was the consumption.
<i>Vide</i> <a href="#Page_185">2nd page</a> of Chap. XXIV.</p>

<p><i>As a general rule,&mdash;no honey should be taken
from a colony the first year of its being planted</i>,
though there may be an extraordinary season
now and then, which may justify a departure
from this rule; but neither in such an uncommon
year, nor even in the second year,
should the whole of the combs in any box be
taken, (unless it be clearly ascertained that the
centre combs contain no brood,) but only the external
ones, which should be examined carefully
one by one, and the brood-combs, if any, be returned
in the box to the stock. The apiarian,
as <span class="smcap">Huber</span> observes, if he wish to obtain a considerable
quantity of honey, should endeavour to
secure his object rather by the number of his
colonies, than by plundering a few of a great
proportion of their treasures. <i>A moderate participation
is the most infallible means of preserving
the stock.</i></p>

the third, if the summer of that year as well as

<p>Should such an accident occur as the destruction
of a queen, by the introduction of a divider (and
she might be so unfortunately situated as to fall
a sacrifice to it), the stock will appear very much
distressed and very restless all day, particularly if
there be no Royal Embryo or no very young
larva; for in either of these cases they will soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">- 166 -</a></span>
become reconciled. But if neither of them be
present, and the bees be left to themselves, they
will lose their wonted activity, gradually dwindle
in number and pine away: or they will transfer
their allegiance to another sovereign; and in that
case, convey all the treasured sweets of their own
hive, to that of the family they join. <i>The only
remedy for such a misfortune</i> is to unite the bees
to another stock, in the manner already directed,
or to procure a supernumerary queen from another

which few will have courage to attempt.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">TAKING HONEY BY MEANS OF DIVIDERS.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span>fter</span> having noted the utility of Dividers, in
adding fresh <i>empty</i> boxes, the reader will readily
perceive their importance in the removal of <i>full</i>
ones, when the period arrives for depriving a
colony of a portion of its honey. In this case,
the two dividers must be introduced between the
middle board of the box to be removed and the
box below it, precisely as in nadir hiving. In
the act of deprivation a little more force will be
required to push in, as well as to withdraw the
divider, as it will generally have to pass through
a portion of honey-comb. The above directions
apply to the removal of an upper box, which will
in general be the first for which they will be required.
When any other is to be taken away,
the plan of proceeding must be varied, but it
would be tedious to give directions for every
case; an intelligent operator by an attention to
the instructions already given, and his own reflection,
will be able to adapt his mode of proceeding
to the particular exigency. Only one
divider should be introduced till the situation of
the queen be ascertained: if she be in the box
intended for removal, the divider must be withdrawn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">- 168 -</a></span>
and the experiment tried again in a week
or two. If in an hour after the introduction of
the divider, the bees in the box intended to be
taken should exhibit symptoms of inquietude, it
may be assumed that the queen is not within that
box, the disturbance being caused by the anxiety
of the bees to have access to her; whereas if she
be in the box, the bees in company with her will
be tranquil, and the excluded portion of the
family will be in a state of commotion. Having,
we will suppose, ascertained that the queen is in
the desired place, the second divider should be
introduced as before directed, when the box,
with one of the dividers underneath it, must be
removed. The apiarian, when performing this
operation for the first time, may find it convenient
to raise a stage of empty bee-boxes or
other convenient articles, on one side or at
the back of the box to be removed, and upon a
level with the bottom of its middle board; he
can then, after having introduced the dividers,
very easily slide the full box, with its middle
board and divider, over his temporary stage.
(This mode of proceeding may likewise be found
applicable on other occasions.) The operation
having proceeded thus far, the box is ready for
being applied over the hole of delivery, where
a floor board should be placed with its sliding
shutter open, and with an uncovered empty box
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">- 169 -</a></span>
upon it. (If the full box were itself placed upon
the floor board, stranger bees might smell the
honey and become very troublesome intruders:&mdash;this
is the reason why an empty box is interposed
betwixt the full one and the floor board.)
The full box and middle board, with the divider
underneath them, being raised upon the empty
box and the divider withdrawn, a portion of the
bees will immediately sally forth, to join the family
from which they have been separated. I
say a portion, for notwithstanding their attachment
to their queen, they will not all quit, without reluctance,
so great a treasure as a box full of honey;
if any of the combs contain brood also, this reluctance
will be increased. When therefore the
bees issue slowly, the sliding shutter should be
closed, and re-opened in a quarter of an hour.
This short imprisonment will produce some impatience
and restlessness, and consequent eagerness
to be set at liberty; and on re-opening the
shutter there will be a fresh sally: this method
must be pursued, at similar successive intervals,
till all or nearly all the bees have quitted the box;
should a few still remain, the box, towards evening,
may be taken out of doors and the stragglers
brushed out upon a board or cloth, with a wing,
and placed upon a support near the entrance to
the stock; those that are not injured by the wing
will soon find their way in: thus will the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">- 170 -</a></span>
operation be completed. But if the upper story
be taken, it will be obvious that either an empty
box or a top board must be placed over the stock.</p>

<p>If this method of deprivation should fail of
success, some other course must be pursued. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Isaac&rsquo;s</span> <i>plan</i> promises well. After removing the
box from the stock, he used to confine his bees in
it, till their anger and agitation had rendered their
prison so hot and uncomfortable, and probably so
unwholesome, by the deterioration of the air, that
they were glad of an opportunity to quit it, which
he soon afforded them. Unscrewing the top of
his box, and introducing a divider underneath it,
he placed an empty box <i>over</i> the full one, and
opened a communication between the two, by
withdrawing the divider. At the same time he
gave an additional impulse to the ascent of the
bees by drumming smartly upon the sides of the
full box. When the bees were entirely or nearly
gone, he took out either the whole of the combs
or such as contained honey without brood, proceeding
according to the directions given in page
163. There is another resource, in <i>the method</i>
uniformly <i>practised by</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Keys</span>, viz. that of
fuming, which is effected by placing an empty box
over the full one, in the manner described above,
and expelling the bees with the smoke of burning
puff balls, probably that of woollen rags would
answer as well, though Mr. Keys relies upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">- 171 -</a></span>
stupifying quality of the puff balls, which however,
he says, is in a great measure lost if the
balls be kept more than a year. The operation
may be afterwards finished in the usual way.</p>

<p>Where straw-hives are used, or where boxes
are surmounted by them, <i>a very simple method</i> of
taking the honey, without destroying the bees,
was <i>adopted by</i> <span class="smcap">J. F. M. Dovaston, Esq.</span> a Salopian
gentleman. I will suppose that he took off
the hive with a middle board and divider underneath
it; he then inverted it upon a kettle of hot
water, fitted to receive the hive without any part
sinking into the water; the whole being surmounted
by an empty box, and the divider withdrawn: in
ten minutes the heat so annoyed the bees, that
they were heard marching, <i>magno cum fremitu</i>,
into the empty hive. In a few minutes, when all
was quiet, the divider being introduced again, the
hive was replaced by the box containing the bees.
Mr. D. found that on this plan not a single bee
remained among the combs. I see no good reason
why a similar practice should not be adopted with
boxes or Moreton-hives; in this case the water in
the kettle should be heated gradually by a chaffing-dish,
and the box or hive should have a perforated
divider under it, like that for uniting
stocks: the empty box had better communicate
with the open air, lest the heat of the steam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">- 172 -</a></span>
should be intolerable to the bees. Having the top
unscrewed would probably answer the purpose, as
it could then be easily pushed on one side. <span class="smcap">Dr.
Evans</span>, when he could not readily dislodge the
bees from the box, had recourse to <span class="smcap">Dr. Warder&rsquo;s</span>
plan of placing it over an inverted empty box,
that contained a lighted sulphur match, the fumes
of which stupified the bees&rsquo;; and on the upper
hive being rapped, they fell down in a state of
insensibility, but soon revived and joined the
family, by the usual entrance. The fumes of
sulphur answered as well as those of the narcotic
fungus recommended by Thorley and Keys,
which it is sometimes difficult to procure and
troublesome to prepare. Immersing the bees in
cold water would answer, with a glass or earthenware
hive. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> was led to adopt it in consequence
of reading Wildman&rsquo;s account of Madame
Vicat&rsquo;s method of clearing her bees from vermin,
by plunging them in water. The chapter on Bee-maladies
contains some remarks on this subject.</p>

<p>At the commencement of my apiarian inquiries,
I felt that there was a want of more minute information
than is given by Keys; and others with
whom I have conversed upon the subject, have had
the same feeling: this has induced me to enter into a
descriptive detail of the whole business of super-hiving,
nadir-hiving, and deprivation. Those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">- 173 -</a></span>
are in possession of "<i>The ancient Bee-master&rsquo;s Farewell</i>,"
will perceive that I have made some alterations
in the boxes of Keys and some additions to
them: the principal of these are the sinking of the
entrances in the floor boards, instead of having
them cut in the lower edges of the boxes; having
fixed bars upon the tops of the boxes, instead of
Keys&rsquo;s loose ones, and the use of middle boards.
The first was my own suggestion, the two last were
improvements made by Mr. Walond. Entrances
made in the floor boards enable the apiarian to
place his boxes upon the boards in whatever direction
he chooses, and render sliding shutters in the
upper boxes unnecessary. The loose bars were
inconvenient, from the bees attaching their combs
to the sides of the boxes, which they almost always
do, as well as from their attaching every
comb to two or three bars. The middle boards
facilitate the introduction of the dividers, secure
the apiator against the effects of any little irregularity
in the adaptation of the boxes to each other,
at the time of adding or taking away, and form a
good foundation for a superstructure of cell-work;
for sometimes the bees depart from their usual
practice of suspending their combs from the roofs
of the boxes, and build from below upwards.</p>

<p>It is the usual custom in this country, to sacrifice
the lives of the bees, in order to get possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">- 174 -</a></span>
of their stores. This is generally done in September,
by setting the hive, late in an evening,
over lighted brimstone matches, placed in a hole
dug in the earth; the soil being quickly drawn
round the hive, as well to prevent the escape of any
of the bees, as to confine the sulphurous gas. In
about a quarter of an hour, if the hive receive a
few smart strokes on its sides, the bees will be
found to have dropped insensible into the hole,
where they are immediately buried; otherwise
they would revive, such of them at least as were
not singed or otherwise injured by the fire. The
heaviest and lightest hives are usually selected
for the purpose, the former as yielding most
profit, the latter as being unlikely to survive the
winter.</p>

<p>If, after a hive of bees has been suffocated, the
apiarian wish to <i>search for the queen</i>, the best
mode of doing so is to lay the whole of the bees
on white paper, or in water on a white shallow
dish, and examine them singly; her colour upon
the back is not so remarkably different from that
of the workers as to be very striking; but on looking
at the under part of her, she will be immediately
recognised.</p>

<p>I adverted to this latter mode of robbing bees
of their treasure in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chap. XIV.</a> and there quoted
the lamentation of Thomson at their fate. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">- 175 -</a></span>
this humane appeal, he has been thus apostrophized
by Dr. Evans.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">THE BEE-DRESS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> Storifying system, when conducted with proper
precaution, in a bee-house, renders a bee-dress
quite superfluous to the apiarian, as all his
operations may be safely performed at all times
and in all weathers, without one.</p>

<p>They may be as securely performed, by the
storifier in a simple shed, if the time of operating
be either early or late in the day, when the bees
are all at home and can be confined by shutting
the slide of the floor board.</p>

<p>Still, as timidity may foster a feeling of insecurity,
and as the armour of a bee-dress may give
confidence to an operator, I shall describe the
dress that appears to me most suitable.</p>

<p>In the first place the apiator should be armed
with <i>a pair of thick cloth gloves</i>, made to tie over
the sleeves of his coat. Secondly, his legs should
be fortified by a <i>double pair of thick woollen or
worsted stockings</i>, or some kind of <i>stout leggings</i>
as they are called. And thirdly, he should be
provided with <i>a short dress of Scotch gauze or catgut</i>.
This dress should be so formed as to tie
round the crown of a hat having a shallow brim
(about 2&frac12; inches deep), should have short sleeves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">- 177 -</a></span>
to tie round the arms, and descend low enough to
tie round the body. <i>A woollen apron</i> should also
be worn, as high as the bottom of the catgut dress,
otherwise, in the language of Mr. Keys, the prying
little insects may find an opening of sufficient size
to enable them to tickle the belly. &ldquo;Women,&rdquo;
says Mr. K. &ldquo;should not meddle with bees, without
a bee-dress, nor then without the addition of a
man&rsquo;s coat, and I had almost said of breeches also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This dress is the most complete mode of securing
an operator from bees or wasps; but if he
be adventurous enough to brave their attacks, I
recommend him first to drink or rinse his mouth
with a little malt liquor; to wash his face and
hands with the same, and to approach them with
a bunch of sweet herbs in his hand, gently fanning
his face with them, whilst he is in the vicinity of
their domicile, and breathing as much as possible
through his nose. (<i>Vide</i> Part II. <a href="#Page_277">Bee&rsquo;s Sting</a>.)
In case of an actual or threatened attack, (the
latter of which may be known by the peculiar
noise which precedes it,) a defence by striking
at them would be highly imprudent. An attempt
may be first made to put them gently away;
should that not succeed, the only resource is to
retire quietly, and to conceal the face in shrubs or
boughs, if any be near, or if not with the hands
spread over it. The bees will then generally
desist from further attack, and go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">- 178 -</a></span></p>

<p>The smart quick strokes of the wings, when
bees are angry and prepared to sting, give a sound
very different from their usual buz. &ldquo;Instead,&rdquo;
says Mr. Hunter, &ldquo;of that soft contented noise
made by the bee when coming home loaded on
a fine evening,&mdash;when a bee meditates an attack
with its sting, it makes a very different one.&rdquo;
There is a piercing shrillness in the sound, as the
author and some of his friends have often experienced.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kirby and Spence, after quoting a
passage from Mr. White&rsquo;s Natural History, relative
to the feigned attacks of some wild bees
near Lewes in Sussex, which &ldquo;with a sharp and
hostile sound dash and strike round the heads and
faces of intruders,&rdquo; make the following observations.
&ldquo;The hive-bee will sometimes have recourse
to the same expedient, when her hive is
approached too near, and thus give you notice
what you may expect, if you do not take her
warning and retire.&mdash;Humble-bees when disturbed,
whether out of the nest or in it, assume
some very grotesque and at the same time threatening
attitudes. If you put your finger to them,
they will either successively or simultaneously
lift up the three legs of one side; turn themselves
upon their back, bend up their anus and show
their sting accompanied by a drop of poison.
Sometimes they will even spirt out that liquor.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption2">FEEDING.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span> stock</span> of bees will, generally, consume a pound
of honey per month, betwixt the 1st of October
and the 1st of March: from this time to the end
of May, they will consume two pounds per month;
<i>if the spring be unfavourable for gathering early,
and less than ten pounds of honey per stock have
been left for their winter&rsquo;s support, and that winter
have proved mild, the bees should be fed early in
the season, and sometimes through a considerable
part of the month of May</i>.</p>

<p>I believe the best spring food for bees is the
following <span class="smcap">compound</span>: A pound of coarse brown
sugar and half a pint of ale or sweet wort, boiled
to the consistence of a syrup, to which may be
added a small portion of salt. According to
Huber <i>the coarsest sugar enables the bees to form
the whitest wax</i>. The above mixture is regarded,
by some, as a useful food for bees even when there
is no deficiency of honey; <i>it is supposed to encourage
early breeding, and to preserve the health
of the bees</i>; I administer it invariably from the
end of February or the beginning of March till the
bees seem to disregard it, which always happens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">- 180 -</a></span>
as soon as the flowers afford them a supply of
honey.</p>

<p>There are two opinions upon <i>the best mode of
administering the syrup</i>: one party gives the preference
to <i>daily feeding, in small quantities;</i> the
other, to <i>introducing a considerable quantity at once</i>,
and repeating it as occasion may require. The
majority of apiarians favour the latter practice;
among the number are <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>, <span class="smcap">Thorley</span>,
<span class="smcap">Isaac</span>, <span class="smcap">Morris</span>, &amp;c. the latter gentleman obtained
an award often guineas from the Society of Arts,
for his method of feeding. The advocates of the
first method are <span class="smcap">Keys</span>, <span class="smcap">Espinasse</span>, and some
others. Copious feeding in effected by filling the
cells on one side of a spare drone comb, laid flat
upon the floor of the hive; or by pouring the
syrup into a dish, or an excavated floor board of
twice the usual thickness, covering the food with
short straws or pieces of reed, about half an inch
long, to prevent the bees from soiling themselves.
The stock being placed in an evening over the
whole,&mdash;in the course of the night, or the following
morning, the bees will carry up the syrup, and
store it in unoccupied cells. Where it has been
ascertained that the bees have not stored a
sufficient quantity of honey to carry them through
the winter and ensuing spring, and it is determined
to furnish them with a supply in the autumn, I
think this method of copious feeding is the best.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">- 181 -</a></span>
But when they are fed in the spring, I think it
preferable to give them about a table-spoonful a
day. This has generally been accomplished, by
introducing into the mouth of the hive a long
boat, formed by scooping out the pith from an
elder stem, and filling it with the composition.
Upon this plan, no more is introduced than the
case requires, and frequent opportunities are
afforded of learning the condition of the bees,
from the manner in which they receive the boon.
If a little irascibility be exhibited, it is a symptom
of health; and though indifference to the proffered
bounty may not actually betoken mischief, yet
it deserves attention, and should induce vigilance
in the apiarian. Feeding upon the large scale in
spring, tempts the bees to fill those cells which
may be wanted for the queen to deposit her eggs
in, and thus proves a drawback upon the strength
and prosperity of the hive. It may also cause the
bees to partake too freely of the syrup, and suffer
from their intemperance. Whichever mode be
adopted, the external entrances must be closed,
during the time of feeding; and I know of no
better contrivance for this purpose than Mr.
Huish&rsquo;s tin guards. Without this precaution,
unfed stranger bees, attracted by the smell of the
syrup, will banquet upon it; and these marauders,
having once tasted the repast, will not only return
to it again and again themselves, but bring in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">- 182 -</a></span>
their train a multitude of others, to the great
injury of the well-fed apiary. The way in which
I feed my own bees is exceedingly simple, and
attended with no risk to the apiarian. At the
close of the gathering season, I turn my boxes
and their floors a quarter round, and adapt to
them a long narrow box with a glass top and two
openings, one at the end, serving as a street door,
the other in the side serving as a hall door leading
into the box, as shown in the following sketch.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/page182.png" width="241" height="182" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In an evening, when the bees are all at home, I
push in the slide of the floor board, raise the
glazed box, and place the syrup under it: then I
close the external entrance, and withdraw the
slide to admit the bees to the food: by morning I
generally find that my donation has been removed.
I place the syrup in a small shallow saucer,
covered over with Scotch gauze, through which
the bees suck it without smearing their wings.
If the gauze hang over the sides of the saucer, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">- 183 -</a></span>
will act as a syphon, and the syrup be wasted: to
obviate this inconvenience, a small hoop of whale-bone,
cane, or other pliable material should be just
dropped within the edges of the saucer, and upon
this hoop the gauze should be stretched, turned
over and secured with a needle and thread.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">I</span> suspect</span> that much which has been written upon
this subject is fanciful, and that most of the ailments
of bees originate from want of cleanliness or want

<p>During a mild winter the stock of honey is often
exhausted, such a season encouraging the bees to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">- 185 -</a></span>
be active, without affording any resources beyond
their own domicile; yet it is not uncommon to
hear the keepers of bees speak of a mild winter
as favourable for the bees. It is most unfavourable
to them; and if feeding be not duly attended
to, frequently fatal. Hence <i>a northern aspect</i> has
been <i>recommended</i> for hives <i>during winter</i>; and if
guarded by proper coverings, and contrivances
against snow and other bad weather, such an aspect
is highly proper. The <span class="smcap">Rev. Stephen
White</span> observes, that if hives be placed on the
northern side of a building, the bees will seldom
be induced to come out, and will eat much less
than if exposed to the winter&rsquo;s sun. <span class="smcap">Mr. Gedde</span>
<i>recommends</i> keeping them during winter, <i>not only</i>
in <i>a cold, but</i> in <i>a dark situation</i>, in order to lessen
the consumption of honey. He even suggests the
use of an ice-house, having found that bees survive
the cold in Siberia, and render Russia somewhat
remarkable for its productiveness of honey.
&ldquo;A very observing gentleman,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Darwin</span>,
&ldquo;at my request, put two hives for many weeks
into a dry cellar, and observed, during all that
time, that they did not consume any of their provision,
for their weight did not decrease, as it had
done when they were kept in the open air.&rdquo; The
same observation is made in the Annual Register
for 1768, p. 113. The sudden transitions from
heat to cold, and from cold to heat, experienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">- 186 -</a></span>
in this country, are detrimental to bees; but these
vicissitudes would not alarm me, if the bees were
well sheltered, and had a convenient supply of
water, salt and sugar, in the early part of the
spring.</p>

<p>Keys thought they were not fond of salt: from
my own experience as well as from that of my
apiarian friends, I am satisfied that he was mistaken,
and my opinion is confirmed by the following
observation in Crevec&#339;ur&rsquo;s Travels. &ldquo;One
day, having remarked that my bees frequently
settled on spots, where brine had been spilt, I
placed some grains of salt before their hives.
What was my astonishment, when I saw them
repeatedly tasting it with eagerness, and carrying
it away with them! Before this experiment, I
could not have believed that the manufacturers of
honey could taste with pleasure, a substance so
different from the nectar of flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>In the winter of 1782-3, a general mortality</i>
took place <i>among the bees</i> in this country, which
was attributed to various causes: want of honey
was not one of them; for in some hives considerable
store was found, after the bees were gone.
Some were of opinion that it arose from the preceding
being a bad breeding year, and thought the
bees died of old age. Others attributed it to the
moistness of the spring of 1783, which rendered
the providing of pollen difficult, for without pollen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">- 187 -</a></span>
no brood can be raised. The difficulty of collecting
pollen was ascribed to the continual closing of
the flowers over the anthers, the want of sun to
burst the anthers, and the washing away of the
pollen by the frequent showers after they did
burst. The fatal influence ascribed to the wetness
of the spring of 1782 seems to be improbable;
though the wet might have affected the quantity
of bees bred, it was not likely to put a stop to
their breeding altogether, and the young bees
ought at any rate to have escaped the desolating
evil, if it were old age alone; yet wherever the
mortality once made its appearance, every bee
became its victim.</p>

<p><i>A similar incident occurred among the wasps in
the year</i> 1824. The queen wasps were unusually
numerous in the spring of that year, and yet
scarcely a wasp could be seen of any sort in the
ensuing summer and autumn, though there was a
great deal of fine weather and plenty of sunshine,
the fruits having ripened remarkably well. In
both cases, it seems probable that the mortality
arose from some unfavourable circumstance at the
breeding season, with which we are unacquainted.
I am not aware that it has been attributed to any
specific distemper of an epidemical nature. <span class="smcap">Mr.
Knight</span> <i>noticed a similar occurrence, as to wasps,
in the year</i> 1806 (Philosophical Transactions 1807,
p. 243); and <i>in</i> 1815, <span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Spence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">- 188 -</a></span></span>
<i>made the same observation</i>. Mr. Knight supposed
the scarcity to arise from a want of males to impregnate
the queens.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to notice the maladies of
bees; and state their causes, symptoms and remedies,
as I have collected them from ancient and
modern authors.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Dysentery.</span></p>

<p>This malady was attributed by <span class="smcap">Columella</span> to
the bees extracting and feeding upon honey collected
from the blossoms of elms and spurge; he
regarded it as an annual distemper. By others
it has been ascribed to their feeding too freely
upon the vernal honey, from whatever source
derived; or from their being obliged to eat wax,
through want of other food, in the early part of
the spring. <span class="smcap">Madame Vicat</span> supposed it to arise
from the feeding upon honey that had been
candied, in consequence of the hive being exposed
to a severe winter. <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> instituted some
experiments to ascertain the cause of dysentery,
but they were not satisfactory.</p>

<p>The presence of this disorder is indicated by
the appearance of the excrement, which, instead
of a reddish yellow, exhibits a muddy black
colour, and has an intolerably offensive smell.
Also by its being voided upon the floors, and at
the entrance of the hives, which bees, in a healthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">- 189 -</a></span>
State, are particularly careful to preserve clean.
<span class="smcap">Huish</span> compares the morbid excrement to linseed.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Vertigo.</span></p>

<p><i>Vertige</i>, as <span class="smcap">Du Carne de Blangy</span> calls it, is
supposed to arise from the bees extracting the
honey of deleterious plants. I have treated fully
upon this subject under the head of Pasturage.
In addition to what has been there stated I will
give an extract from <span class="smcap">Dr. Barton&rsquo;s</span> <i>Paper</i>, who
after observing that there is more poetry than
philosophy in the following lines of Pope&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;In the nice bee what sense so subtly true<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p0">says: &ldquo;It is however much to be questioned
whether this noxious honey proves so to the bees
themselves.&rdquo; Sir J. E. Smith asserts that &ldquo;the
nectar of plants is not poisonous to bees.&rdquo; <i>Syllabus
to Botan. Lect.</i> And Dr. Barton, though
disposed to adopt the contrary opinion, gives
instances to the same effect. Thus a party of
young men, induced by the prospect of gain,
having removed their hives from <i>Pennsylvania</i> to
<i>the Jerseys</i>, whose vast savannahs were finely
painted with the flowers of the <i>Kalmia angustifolia</i>,
could not use or dispose of their honey, on account
of its intoxicating quality; yet, &ldquo;the bees increased
prodigiously,&rdquo; an increase only to be explained by
their being well and <i>harmlessly</i> fed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">- 190 -</a></span></p>

<p>This disorder is marked, we are told, by a
dizzy manner of flying, and by irregular motions,
such as starting, falling down, &amp;c. when the bees
are pursuing their usual occupations. To these
symptoms succeed lassitude and death. No remedy
has hitherto been discovered for this malady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huber</span> <i>says that vertigo attacks ants</i>, and causes
them to lose the power of moving in a straight
line, and occasions the performance of rapid gyrations
always in the same direction: he observed
one insect make about 1000 turns in an hour,
describing a circle of about an inch in diameter;
this continued for seven days: he does not say
whether he ever knew any instance of a recovery.</p>

<p>In Dr. Barton&rsquo;s ingenious paper, to which I
have already referred in the chapter on Pasturage,
the plants enumerated as yielding poisonous honey
are <i>Kalmia angustifolia, latifolia</i>, and <i>hirsuta</i>;
<i>Rhododendron maximum</i>, <i>Azalea nudiflora</i>, and
<i>Andromeda mariana</i>. The honey of these is stated
to have proved injurious both to dogs and the
human species. <i>The symptoms</i> it usually produces
<i>are dimness of sight or vertigo, delirium,
ebriety, pain in the stomach and bowels, convulsions,
profuse perspiration, foaming at the mouth, vomiting
and purging</i>; in some instances, <i>temporary
palsy of the limbs</i>, but very <i>seldom death</i>. The
best mode of treatment is not yet ascertained;
though the similarity of the symptoms, the Doctor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">- 191 -</a></span>
says, would induce us to pursue the same plan as
in counteracting other narcotic poisons. In those
cases, <i>early vomiting</i>, whether spontaneous or induced
by art, removes the disease at once; and
<i>cold bathing</i>, so useful in other spasmodic or convulsive
affections, is employed with considerable
advantage by both Natives and Europeans. This
should seem to be one of those cases in which
the <i>stomach-pump</i> would be peculiarly beneficial,
from the promptness and certainty of its action.</p>

<p>To the credit of the genus of plants last named,
it should be mentioned that one species (<i>Andromeda
nitida</i> or <i>lucida</i> of <span class="smcap">Bartram</span>) affords abundance of
excellent honey; hence the name of <i>honey-flower</i>
is given to it, by the country people in <i>Georgia</i>
and <i>Carolina</i>, not however merely from the circumstance
just mentioned, but from the regular
position of the flowers on the peduncle, which
open like the cells of a honey-comb, and from the
odour of these flowers, which greatly resembles
that of honey."&mdash;<i>Barton</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As most of the plants enumerated in the above
list are now introduced into our gardens, and the
<i>Datura</i> (<i>common Thorn Apple</i>) has long become
perfectly naturalized, they might be supposed to
injure the British honey. Most probably, however,
their proportion to the whole of the flowers
in bloom, is too small to produce any such
inconvenience; whereas on their native continent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">- 192 -</a></span>
they exclusively cover whole tracts of country, as
instanced above in the Jerseys.&rdquo; <i>Evans</i>, B. ii. p. 95.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Tumefaction of the Antenn&aelig;.</span></p>

<p>The antenn&aelig;, in this disorder, become swelled
at their extremities, which resemble the bud of a
flower ready to open, and they assume a yellow
colour, of which the forepart of the head shortly
partakes; the bees becoming gradually languid
and dying, if they have not timely assistance.&mdash;This
malady occurs about the month of May.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Pestilence</span>, or <span class="smcap">Faux Couvain</span> (<i>as Schirach calls it</i>).</p>

<p>Pestilence has been reckoned among bee-maladies,
and attributed to the residence of dead
larv&aelig; in the cells, from a careless deposition of
ova by the queen, (the head of the grub not being
placed in a proper position for exclusion, when
that period has arrived,) it has also been ascribed
to cold, and to bad nursing, that is, feeding with
unwholesome food.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span></p>

<p>The remedies which have been found most
successful in all these maladies, excepting vertigo,
are <i>cordials</i>, namely <i>wine</i> and <i>sugar</i>. This circumstance,
taken in conjunction with their occurring at
the spring of the year, tends to confirm my opinion
that the ailments of bees arise from hunger and
filth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">- 193 -</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cleanliness</i> and <i>timely supplies of sugared ale</i>,
particularly <i>during the months of February and
March</i>, are the preventive remedies which have
hitherto preserved my bees in a state of healthful
activity. In ungenial springs, feeding should be
continued even <i>through a considerable part of
May</i>, if the preceding autumn have been unfavourable,
or if a cold May have succeeded to
warm weather in early spring,&mdash;the earliest vernal
flowers affording but a scanty supply of honey.
The apiarian is sometimes astonished that he
should lose his bees at this advanced season of the
year, when but a short time before he had seen
them in full health and activity. Had he afforded
that food which his bees could not obtain from a
comparatively immature and honeyless vegetation,
their hives would still have gladdened him with
the spectacle of a thriving population.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If e&rsquo;er dank autumn, with untimely storm,<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The reader must now perceive the importance
of feeding, and that the transition from health to
languor and death is less frequently to be ascribed
to disease, than to the want of the necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">- 194 -</a></span>
means to continue the vital energy. The suddenness
of the unhappy change may reasonably lead
the uninformed or improvident to suppose that
an incurable malady has visited their hives:&mdash;so
long as the store of honey lasted, there were health
and prosperity; but that gone, famine commenced
its ravages, and an extinction of the bees of course
followed. A little foresight and a little trouble
would have kept off the calamity. I am perhaps
tediously particular in this notice. I wish to impress
my noviciate bee-friends with the necessity
of thus providing for their hives, that the most
frequent agent of mischief,&mdash;hunger,&mdash;may be kept
out of them. Still further let me also recommend
to them, on the approach of winter to have the
floors of their hives or boxes well cleaned from
insects and their eggs, and from all heterogeneous
matter. This is a business which the bees themselves,
when the weather admits of it, are particularly
attentive to; indeed they refrain, as
much as possible, from dropping their excrement
upon the floors, taking advantage of every fine
day in winter to sally forth and get rid of it. This
was proved by the experiments of Mr. Hunter: indeed
they sometimes fall a sacrifice to their personal
neatness in this respect, their bodies becoming
so swelled, from the accumulation of f&aelig;ces, as completely
to disable them from flying, when the weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">- 195 -</a></span>
is sufficiently favourable to admit of their
going out; in consequence of which, they fall
to the ground and perish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schirach</span> and others recommend, in cases of
<i>Faux Couvain</i>, to cut out the infected combs, and
to clean and fumigate the hive by burning aromatics
under it.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Butler&rsquo;s</span> <i>Feminine Monarchie</i>, we are gravely
told of a certain bee-mistress, who, finding her
hives fruitless, and their tenants pining away with
sickness, by the advice of another female, went to
receive the eucharist, and having kept it in her
mouth, placed it, on her return home, in one of
the diseased hives. The plague ceased; honey
accumulated; and, on examining the inside, she
found a waxen chapel and altar, of wondrous
architecture, and even bells of the same materials.&mdash;Gent.
Mag. 1809. p. 316.</p>

<p>To prove that there is much of fancy in the
traditional accounts respecting bee-maladies, I
will mention <i>the various hypotheses concerning
dysentery</i>. <span class="smcap">Columella</span> speaks of its arising from
the bees feeding upon honey collected from elm
and spurge blossoms; my own neighbourhood
abounds with both; but I never met with nor
scarcely heard of dysentery among the bees here.
<span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> in his <i>Sylva</i> expresses doubts upon the
subject; and <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> says he made particular
inquiries of some friends in Worcestershire, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">- 196 -</a></span>
(like this county&mdash;Herefordshire) abounds with
elms, without obtaining satisfactory information.</p>

<p>Dysentery has also been said to be produced by
a surfeit of vernal honey, simply as such, from
whatever flowers derived: were this true it would
occur in all neighbourhoods. With respect to
its proceeding from their eating wax, I am decidedly
of opinion that wax never constitutes any
part of their food, under any circumstances; not
a tittle of evidence can be adduced in support of
such an assertion. Wax is an excrementitious
matter, secreted among the abdominal folds of the
bees for the sole purpose of constructing the
honey and brood-combs: the scraps of wax that
are observed in winter and spring upon the hive
floors, and which, to the minds of common observers,
convey the idea that they are crumbs caused
by the bees consuming the wax for food, are produced
by their nibbling the lids of the cells to
uncover the honey. If <span class="smcap">Madame Vicat&rsquo;s</span> <i>theory</i>
were correct, what would become of all the bees
in Siberia and other northern regions? Huish
says he never found honey in this country to
candy in the combs, but adds that Bonner assured
him that <i>he</i> had experienced it. <i>Vide</i> chapter on
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX">Honey</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span> have given it as their
opinion, that dysentery arises from the bees
having an insufficiency of pollen or bee-bread to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">- 197 -</a></span>
eat with their honey. We have no evidence that
pollen constitutes any part of the food of <i>adult</i>
bees; and if it did, they have generally opportunities
of storing it very abundantly, in the autumn,
as well as in the spring: and such is the provident
industry of bees, that a considerable surplus is
always found in every stock-hive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wildman</span> and <span class="smcap">Huish</span> recommend salt for preserving
the health of bees; and their frequenting
stable drains and other receptacles of urine gives
countenance to this recommendation, as it seems
probable that the saline matter contained in
those fluids attracts the bees, their desire for it
overcoming that repugnance to offensive odours
which would otherwise occasion them to avoid
such places. Even fresh urine has been recommended
by <span class="smcap">Ranconi</span>, an <i>Italian</i> author, in case
the bees should be attacked by dysentery;&mdash;in all
probability a weak solution of salt would be more
acceptable and equally efficacious. I always introduce
a small portion of it into the syrup with
which I feed my bees. <span class="smcap">Keys</span> says that they are
not fond of salt. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#Page_186">Page 186</a>.</p>

<p>I will close this chapter on the Diseases of
Bees with an extract from Nicholson&rsquo;s Journal,
vol. xxiii. p. 234: Scientific Intelligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large swarm of bees having settled on a
branch of <i>the poison ash</i>, (<i>Rhus Vernix</i>,) in the
county of West Chester in America, was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">- 198 -</a></span>
into a hive of fir at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
and removed to the place where it was to remain,
at nine. About five the next morning the bees
were found dead, swelled to double their natural
size, and black, except a few, which appeared
torpid and feeble, and soon died on exposure to
the air.&rdquo; This was attributed to their being
poisoned by the effluvia of the <i>Rhus Vernix</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">ENEMIES OF BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span>mong</span> the enemies of bees are enumerated various
kinds of birds, poultry, mice, wax-moths,
slugs, hornets, wasps, woodlice, ants, and spiders.</p>

<p>The most destructive enemies of the bee, in this
country, are <i>wasps</i>, whose superior strength, boldness
and number, enable them to commit great
ravages in a hive. One wasp is supposed to be
a match for three bees, and, to filch a belly-full
of honey, will oppose a host of bees in a very
daring manner.</p>

<p>The <i>wax-moth</i> (<i>Tinea mellonella</i>) is also a dangerous
enemy. <span class="smcap">Mr. Espinasse</span> says that this is
the smallest of the genus, and it is of a whitish
brown colour. The butterfly usually appears about
weak hives in April, and may be seen till the end
of October. This insect is remarkably active in
its movements; and if the approach to the hives
be observed of a moonlight evening, the moths
will be found flying, or running round the hives,
watching an opportunity to enter; whilst the bees
that have to guard the entrances against their
intrusion, will be seen acting as vigilant sentinels,
performing continual rounds near this important
post, extending their antenn&aelig; to the utmost, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">- 200 -</a></span>
moving them to the right and to the left alternately.
Woe to the unfortunate moth that comes
within their reach! &ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Huber</span>,
&ldquo;to observe how artfully the moth knows to
profit, to the disadvantage of the bees, which require
much light for seeing objects; and the precautions
taken by the latter in reconnoitring,
and expelling so dangerous an enemy.&rdquo; Adroitly
gliding between the guards, the moths will often
contrive to insinuate themselves, unperceived, into
the hives, and riot upon the honey. When they
have obtained possession, they deposit their eggs
upon the sides of the combs; the caterpillar is
formed and inclosed in a case of white silk; at
first, it is like a mere thread, but gradually increases
to the size of a quill, and during its growth
feeds upon the wax around it. It seems very
extraordinary, and would be almost incredible if
the fact were not well attested, that such tiny
creatures should live in the midst, and at the expense
of myriads of such formidable insects as
bees, protected as they are by coats of mail,
armed with weapons of offence, and ever watchful
of their treasure. Such, however, is the havoc
sometimes made by these apparently insignificant,
but active enemies, as now and then to compel a
colony of bees to emigrate, and seek another
habitation.</p>

<p>In this country, where the apiary is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">- 201 -</a></span>
situated near the dwelling, <i>birds</i> do not commit
any great ravages. <span class="smcap">Mr. Espinasse</span> thinks that
in general they come only for <i>dead bees</i> and <i>larv&aelig;</i>,
which may have been thrown out of the hives.
But in America, according to <span class="smcap">Mr. Hector St.
John</span>, <i>the king bird</i>, the protector of corn-fields
from the depredation of crows, is a great destroyer
of bees. After shooting these birds, Mr.
St. John has found bees in their craws, from one
of which he took as many as a hundred-and-seventy-one:
on laying them all on a blanket in
the sun, fifty-four of them returned to life, licked
themselves clean, and joyfully went back to their
hives. Many wonderful tales of this kind have
been told,&mdash;such as the recovery of flies that had
been inclosed for a considerable time in bottles
of liquor (madeira). An instance of this is related
by Wildman, who says his informant was a
very ingenious and accurate gentleman:&mdash;that the
madeira had been brought, in bottle, from Virginia
to London, and that the flies when exposed
to a warm sun for an hour or two, were so completely
reanimated, as to take wing; thus putting
to the test, as Wildman&rsquo;s friend observed, the
truth of the opinion, that a fly cannot be drowned.&mdash;A
very marvellous tale was related last year in
the newspapers, of the recovery of some apparently
dead bees after the substance containing
them had been submitted to a considerable heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">- 202 -</a></span>
or to a chemical process. Mr. St. John&rsquo;s statement
is within the bounds of credibility: it seems
to have been a case of suspended animation of
short continuance, not produced by exposure to
gas or to any liquid likely to prove deleterious to
them; and it is well known that bees often recover
even after suffocation with sulphurous gas.
Bees may be immersed in water for a long
time, without loss of life. Reaumur saw them recover
after nine hours immersion. Dr. Evans
accidentally left some eighteen hours in water;
when laded out with a spoon and placed in the
sunshine the majority of them recovered. Other
animals, of analogous species, exhibit still more
wonderful resurrections. De Geer has observed
one species of mite to live for some time in spirit
of wine; and Mr. Kirby states that being desirous
of preserving a very pretty lady-bird, and not
knowing how to accomplish it, he immersed it in
geneva. &ldquo;After leaving it,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in this
situation a day and a night, and seeing it without
motion, I concluded it was dead, and laid it in the
sun to dry. It no sooner, however, felt the
warmth than it began to move, and afterwards
flew away.&rdquo; This circumstance laid the foundation
of Mr. K.&rsquo;s study of entomology.</p>

<p>Of this adherence to life, advantage has been
taken at the time of deprivation,&mdash;recourse having
been had to immersion for removing a portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">- 203 -</a></span>
the combs, the bees were afterwards spread on a
cloth in the sun, and became reanimated. Dr. Derham
says that he has known bees revive after
remaining twenty-four hours under an exhausted
air-pump. After long submersion the proboscis
of the bee is generally unfolded, and stretched to
its full length. The first symptom of returning
animation, is a motion at its extremity, succeeded
by a similar motion at the extremities of the
legs. Having so far progressed towards recovery,
the tongue is soon folded up again, and the bee
prepared to resume its customary occupations.</p>

<p><i>Moths</i> and <i>spiders</i> should be watched and destroyed
in an evening, as at that time the former
are hovering about, and the latter laying their
snares; at that time too there would be less
danger of annoying the bees, or of being annoyed
by them. Wherever moths have gained possession
of a hive, it is always necessary to destroy
the bees, or to drive them into another hive.</p>

<p>Attention to the following particulars may guard
the bees from many of their enemies. A frequent
cleaning of the hive floors; the use of new or well
cleaned hives; the timely renewal of the coverings,
and keeping the ground bare around the
apiary, particularly in front of it. This last precaution
may also prevent the entanglement of the
bees in rubbish or long straggling vegetables,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">- 204 -</a></span>
should they on their return home fall down
through fatigue or the weight of their loads.</p>

<p>From <i>rats</i> and <i>mice</i> the surest safeguard is an
appropriate position of the hives; traps may also
be laid, and in winter the entrances into the hives
contracted. It will be prudent likewise to case
the legs of the bee-benches with tin. Bees in a
healthy vigorous state will attack and kill an intruding
mouse; but in winter it might commit
great depredations, and cause the emigration of
the bees on the return of warm weather. (Mr.
Espinasse says that he has known a mouse take
up his winter quarters in a hive, without destroying
the bees.)</p>

<p>For protection against <i>ants</i>, which sometimes
enter the hives and eat the honey, <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobbett</span>,
in his <i>Cottage Economy</i>, recommends that the
pedestals or legs of the benches supporting the
hives should be surrounded by a green stick,
twisted into a circular form and covered with
<i>tar</i>; and if the ant nest can be traced, that <i>boiling
water</i> should be poured into the centre of it, at
night, when all the family are at home. The tarring
of the stick should be repeated every two or
three days: the legs of the stool, or the posts
on which the shed stands, may also be tarred.
Some bees may be lost by sticking in the tar, but
this disadvantage will be more than counter-balanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">- 205 -</a></span>
by the destruction of the ants. <i>Slaked
lime</i> may be beneficially spread about a foot wide
round the apiary. The usual custom has been
to renew this sprinkling of lime every two or
three days: but the <i>experiments of</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Coleridge</span>
(Southey&rsquo;s Brazil, i. 645) show that this step is
unnecessary: by exposure to the air, lime is converted
into chalk; and according to Mr. C, (who
states that the formic acid transpires from the
bodies of ants so as to leave its traces upon the
substances which they traverse,) if ants attempt to
pass over chalk, the effervescence produced between
the chalk and the acid will be so considerable
as to burn their legs. It has been said that
a bee cannot kill an ant, when bitten; but that
the bee instead of making resistance, flies away
and carries the ant with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Reaumur</span> was of opinion that ants were
not to be reckoned among the enemies of bees;
and he relates an instance of their living as very
close neighbours, yet in perfect harmony. The
ants established themselves between the glass
panes of his bee-box and the wooden shutters
which covered them; and as a similar circumstance
occurred to <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span>, and in other of
Reaumur&rsquo;s hives also, it seems probable that the
ants took up their quarters in this situation for
the sake of the equable warmth that the bees
would impart to their eggs. &ldquo;Ants were without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">- 206 -</a></span>
the hive,&rdquo; says Reaumur, &ldquo;and bees within;
a single glass only separating two nations, so different
in manners, in customs, and genius. The
bees were abundantly provided with a dainty of
which ants are exceedingly fond, I mean honey.
The ants had just reason to be apprehensive that
the bees would be uneasy, and jealous to preserve
so precious a treasure. Nevertheless the utmost
harmony and concord prevailed between the two
nations. Not a single ant was tempted to enter
the hive, how strongly soever she might be invited
by the fragrance of the honey; nor did any bee
disturb the ants, though superior to them in
power; the several individuals, on each side,
went in and out peaceably; they would meet in
the way without teazing or molesting one another:
respect on one side, and complacency on the other,
were the foundation of this peace.&rdquo;&mdash;Nat. History
of Bees, p. 352.</p>

<p>The destruction of <i>queen wasps</i> and <i>queen hornets</i>
in the spring, and of wasps&rsquo; and hornets&rsquo; nests in the
summer, will prove the best security against those
formidable enemies. None but queen wasps and
queen hornets appear in the spring. Everyone which
is then annihilated would probably have been the
founder of a kindred colony, and every colony of
wasps at a moderate computation may be calculated
to produce at least 30,000 in a season. These destroyers
may often be watched to their homes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">- 207 -</a></span>
exterminated in the night, by brimstone, gunpowder,
or boiling water.</p>

<p>The wooden guards invented by Espinasse, or
the tin guards of Huish, will be very useful in
case of a formidable attack, and had better be
made use of if an assault be apprehended from
these predatory insects.</p>

<p>Powder and shot are the only protectors from
the visits of <i>birds</i>.</p>

<p>The exclusion of <i>poultry</i> must be left to the
ingenuity of the apiarian.</p>

<p>In an ungenial autumn, it is not uncommon for
<i>bees that are ill-managed and not properly fed, to
plunder the hoards of their own species</i>, and bees
that have thus acquired predatory habits, become
great annoyers of industrious and well-fed colonies;
they are known by the name of corsair
bees. On these occasions spies are said to be
sent our to ascertain the respective strengths of
neighbouring colonies, and to select the weakest
for attack. <i>They make similar attacks upon the
nests of humble-bees, as well as upon the bees
themselves</i>; in the former case they will carry off
almost the whole of the stores that have been
collected, unrepulsed by its proprietors; and in
the latter case, says <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, &ldquo;the humble-bee,
accustomed to such exactions, yields up its honey,
and resumes its flight.&rdquo; In both cases it renews
its labour in the fields, and repairs with its surplus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">- 208 -</a></span>
treasure to its usual asylum, and that even after
repeated robberies. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hubbard</span> says that he
has known repeated instances of weak stocks
being expelled from their hives by strong ones.
<i>The best remedies</i> for this evil are <i>the contraction
of the entrances</i>, as for guarding against wasps, <i>or
a change in the situation of the hives.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Darwin</span> in his <i>Phytologia</i> has related an
instance of a besieged hive being removed to a
distant and more easterly part of the same garden:
the assailants in this case did not follow, and the
bees resumed their usual occupations. Removal
to a still greater distance would seem to promise
more certain relief. In order to raise their courage
above its natural height when thus attacked,
<span class="smcap">Schirach</span> <i>recommends mixing a little wine or
brandy with honey, and presenting it to the bees
that are besieged</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huber</span> has called the attention of Naturalists
to what he designated <i>as a new enemy of bees</i>, the
<i>Sphinx Atropos</i> or <i>Death&rsquo;s-head Hawk-moth</i>, to
which his attention seems to have been first directed
in 1804. This gigantic moth, which derives
its name from having upon its back a mark
somewhat resembling a death&rsquo;s head, has, from
this cause together with its size, (which at first
caused it to be mistaken for a bat,) produced
great alarm amongst the people of some countries,
being regarded by them as the harbinger of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">- 209 -</a></span>
calamity. <span class="smcap">Kuhn</span> speaks of its having been noticed
in the apiaries of some monks at the close
of the last century, as well as in the bee-houses
of other persons: and <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>, in his <i>Travels</i>,
mentions it as plundering the wild bees in <i>Africa</i>
of their honey. This moth makes its appearance
towards the close of summer: it has the
faculty of emitting a shrill mournful cry, which,
when threatened by the vengeance of the bees, has
the power of disarming their fury. It operates
upon them like the voice of their queen, and thus
enables the moth to commit the greatest ravages
in the hives, with perfect impunity. Huber ascertained
that it could not produce the same effect
upon humble-bees; for whenever <i>their</i> nests are
entered by one of these insects, it is immediately
attacked and driven out. One that Huber introduced
into a nest of humble-bees was actually
stung to death by them, but not till many wounds
had been inflicted upon its most sensible part, the
belly. On dissecting one of these moths, he found
a table-spoonful of pure honey in its abdomen.
The proceedings of bees, when attacked by the
<i>Sphinx Atropos</i>, as detailed in the Chapter on
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXIII">Instincts</a>, will suggest to the apiarian the best plan
to be adopted, whenever this formidable insect
shall invade their territories.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">EXOTIC BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">B</span>ees</span> are, in all probability, the most universal
of all animals; and notwithstanding their impatience
of cold, they seem adapted to live in all
climates. They are accordingly to be met with
in every quarter of the globe, and in every quarter
they seem to flourish, if duly attended to.</p>

<p><i>In all tropical climates there are little black bees
without stings.</i> Those of Guadaloupe are only
half the size of those in Europe, and are rounder
in their form. They build in hollow trees, or in
the cavities of rocks by the sea-side, where they
lay up their honey in cells about the size and
shape of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg; these cells are of a
black or deep violet colour, and joined together,
so as to leave no space between them; they hang
in clusters almost like a bunch of grapes; each
cell somewhat resembles a small bottle or bladder;
when filled with honey the cell is closed up.</p>

<p>The honey collected by these bees is said not
to be so unpalatable nor so surfeiting as that of
Europe. By unpalatable I conceive the writers
merely to mean, that it has less of that peculiar
flavour which European honey possesses. A
writer in the 15th volume of the Philosophical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">- 211 -</a></span>
Transactions, states that their honey is always in
a fluid state, and as clear as rock water, forming
an agreeable beverage, which taken on an empty
stomach in the quantity of about half a pint, acts
medicinally in about two hours, but not so when
taken with the meals.</p>

<p>There is a species of bees in Guiana which
gather very delicious honey, and have no stings.
These also construct their combs in a different
manner from the hive-bee of our hemisphere.
According to Huber&rsquo;s translator, <i>there are bees
in India that construct under the boughs of a tree
a single comb of very large dimensions</i>. The
most interesting account of exotic bees that I
have met with, is in Mr. Basil Hall&rsquo;s highly instructive
and entertaining Journal written on the
coasts of Chili, Peru and Mexico, in 1820, -1, and
-2, of which I shall here give a transcript.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Plaza, we went to a house where
a bee-hive of the Country was opened in our
presence. The bees, the honey-comb, and the
hive, differ essentially from those in England.
The hive is generally made out of a log of wood
from two to three feet long and eight or ten
inches in diameter, hollowed out, and closed at
the ends by circular doors, cemented closely to
the wood, but capable of being removed at pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some persons use cylindrical hives, made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">- 212 -</a></span>
earthenware, instead of the clumsy apparatus of
wood; these are relieved by raised figures and
circular rings, so as to form rather handsome ornaments
in the verandah of a house, where they
are suspended by cords from the roof, in the
same manner that the wooden ones in the village
are hung to the eaves of the cottage. On one side
of the hive, half-way between the ends, there is
a small hole made, just large enough for a loaded
bee to enter, and shaded by a projection to prevent
the rain from trickling in. In this hole,
generally representing the mouth of a man, or
some monster, the head of which is moulded in
the clay of the hive, a bee is constantly stationed,
whose office is no sinecure<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>, for the hole is so
small, he has to draw back every time a bee
wishes to enter or to leave the hive. A gentleman
told me that the experiment had been made, by
marking the sentinel; when it was observed that
the same bee continued at his post a whole day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> If the Mexican bees enter the hives with as much rapidity
and in as great numbers as Reaumur states they do
in this part of the world, it would indeed be no sinecure.
He observes that the population of a hive amounts to 18,000,
and that a hundred enter in a minute; if as many go out
in the same time, I think the sentinel must rather stand on
one side of the entrance than within it.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;When it is ascertained by the weight that the
hive is full, the end pieces are removed, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">- 213 -</a></span>
honey withdrawn. The hive we saw opened was
only partly filled, which enabled us to see the
&#339;conomy of the interior to more advantage. The
honey is not contained in the elegant hexagonal cells
of our hives, but in wax bags, not quite so large as
an egg. These bags or bladders are hung round
the sides of the hive, and appear about half full,
the quantity being probably just as great as the
strength of the wax will bear without tearing. Those
near the bottom being better supported, are more
filled than the upper ones. In the centre of the
lower part of the hive, we observed an irregular-shaped
mass of comb furnished with cells, like those
of our bees, all containing young ones, in such
an advanced state that when we broke the comb
and let them out, they flew merrily away. During
this examination of the hive, the comb and the
honey were taken out, and the bees disturbed in
every way; but they never stung us, though our
faces and hands were covered with them. It is
said, however, that there is a bee in the country
which does sting; but the kind we saw seem to
have neither the power nor the inclination, for
they certainly did not hurt us; and our friends
said they were always &lsquo;muy manso,&rsquo; very tame,
and never stung any one. The honey gave out
a rich aromatic perfume, and tasted differently
from ours, but possessed an agreeable flavour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the periodicals of the last year, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">- 214 -</a></span>
observed that there has been an importation of
the stingless bees into this country. I doubt the
success of their establishment here, as the fruits of
their labours may very soon become the prey of
wasps and corsair bees, and even of the hive-bees
which, in a dearth of honey or when from a paucity
of numbers a hive is weakly defended, will
commit depredations upon one another. The
stingless bees having no weapon of defence which
enables them to cope with armed assailants must
soon be exterminated. In their native clime, where
there is an abundance of sweets, no temptations
to predatory attack may occur; but in our hemisphere,
as Buffon has observed, there are hundreds
of lazy creatures, fond of honey and disliking
labour, that would, but for the weapons of defence
possessed by our bees, invade their hives and
carry off the treasures.</p>

<p>Honey-bees do not appear to have been among
the native productions of North America, though
they have now become general throughout that
continent. When established there, they extended
themselves somewhat in advance of the white
population; in consequence of which they were
called by the native Indians, the white man&rsquo;s
flies, and were regarded as indicating the approach
of European settlements.&mdash;Jefferson&rsquo;s Virginia.</p>

<p>An elegant modern writer has observed upon
this subject, that &ldquo;a few years ago the hum of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">- 215 -</a></span>
bee had never been heard on the western side of
Alleghany Mountains: but that a violent hurricane
having carried several swarms over that
lofty ridge, they found there a new unexhausted
country, singularly favourable to their propagation,
where they have multiplied, till the whole
of those boundless savannahs and plains have been
colonized by these indefatigable emigrants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From what I have said above, it would seem
that the bees of all tropical climates store their
honey in cells or bags of large dimensions; but
from Mr. Basil Hall&rsquo;s account it appears that the
bees of South America build small cells also, resembling
those of our hive-bees; and in all probability
this is the case with those of other hot
climates, and that these small cells are merely
used as receptacles for the young brood.</p>

<p class="caption2">SEPARATION OF WAX AND HONEY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span>fter</span> deprivation, the box or hive containing
the combs should be kept in a warm room, till
it is convenient to drain it of its contents, as
the more fluid the honey, the sooner and the
more completely will it run off; this is of course
a reason for not deferring the draining longer than
can be avoided.</p>

<p>The combs should be separated from the boxes
or hives with the broad spatula and the double-edged
instrument recommended in chapter XI.
and placed afterwards on a clean dish. The
waxen covers, on both sides of the scaled combs,
should be sliced off, when by placing them on a
hair sieve the honey will run through tolerably
fine, and may be caught in an earthen pan. For
prime purposes the purest combs should be
selected, and their honey passed through a separate
sieve. Mr. Isaac recommends letting this
fine honey drop through the sieve into a silk sarse,
such as is used by the apothecary for sifting fine
powders, and from the sarse into an earthen
pan; this would enable the apiarian to obtain
his honey in a more depurated state. The sarse
must be first wetted, or the honey will not run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">- 217 -</a></span>
through it. If the weather be cool, this business
should be done in a room where there is a fire.</p>

<p>The ordinary combs may be chopped up, or
broken down with the hands, and together with
the refuse combs after draining, may be thrown
into as much clear water as will cause the wax to
swim: the whole may remain in this state for some
days to dissolve all the honey for making common
mead; or the combs may be spread out upon
broad dishes, and set before the bees in an evening,
as also the utensils which have been employed
during the process, first strewing them over with
short straws, to prevent the bees from smearing
their wings. The former is the best mode of disposing
of the refuse combs and utensils, as the
latter is apt to produce quarrelling and robberies.</p>

<p>The combs having been cleared as completely
as possible, the finest should be boiled in water
enough to float them, till they are thoroughly
melted: the melted mass should be poured into a
canvass bag, made in the form of a jelly bag, with
a draw tape or string at the top, and then be suspended
over a tub or pan of cold water. The
strings of the bag being tightly drawn, the expression
may be effected in various ways. Some
press the bag between two strong round sticks,
tied or strapped together at their ends, so as to
resemble a pair of nut-crackers, with which two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">- 218 -</a></span>
persons may by repeatedly stripping down the
sides of the bag, express the whole of the wax.
Others express it by making an inclined plane of
a board about four feet long, placing one end of
it in the tub or pan of water, and the other against
the breast of the assistant, who puts the bag on
the board and passes a round stick firmly down
it, as long as the wax will run. A screw press,
made hot, would of course answer the purpose
better than either of the above modes.</p>

<p>The crumbled combs might be put over the
fire, in a steam kettle, with water under it, and
the wax which runs through might be afterwards
melted again and passed through the bag. The
new combs will melt almost entirely; but the old
ones, owing to their cells having received so many
linings, will preserve their form, the wax running
from them but in small quantities.</p>

<p>The vessel used for melting the wax should
be capable of containing a good deal more than
is put into it, as the contents may boil up suddenly,
and occasion loss and inconvenience as well
as danger. The wax having been separated
from the water in which it was melted, should
be remelted with just water enough to prevent
burning; and having been well skimmed, may be
poured into proper moulds for forming cakes,
the vessels being first rinsed with cold water to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">- 219 -</a></span>
prevent the wax from adhering to them. The
melted wax should be placed near the fire and
covered over, to cool gradually, or the cakes will
be liable to crack. If it be desirable to have the
wax in a very pure state, it may be boiled over
and over again with fresh water.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">WAX.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">W</span>ax</span> is a solid compact unctuous substance,
generally of a yellow colour. It is secreted by
animals and vegetables, but the vegetable secretion
of it is often combined with resin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees-wax</span> may be said to be a concrete animal
oil, holding the same relation to the fixed oils that
resin does to the essential oils. It is secreted by
certain small sacklets on the body of the bee, as
occasion requires, for constructing the combs in
which the family provision and the young brood
are deposited; the wax of commerce is procured
by melting down these combs, in the manner
already described.</p>

<p><i>Prime wax</i> is of a bright yellow colour and an
agreeable odour, somewhat like that of honey.
The best is procured from combs which have
been either wholly unoccupied, or occupied by
nothing but honey. When first secreted, it is
white, semitransparent, and very fragile: it afterwards
becomes stronger, and assumes more or
less of a yellow hue. This deepening of colour
is owing, partly, to its being covered with a
yellowish varnish by the bees, (for an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">- 221 -</a></span>
which see &ldquo;Architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Propolis,&rdquo;) and
is partly the effect of age.</p>

<p>Independently of its colour, the goodness of
wax may also be estimated by the passing of the
thumb nail forcibly over its surface: if good, the
nail will pass with a kind of jerk; but if no obstruction
be felt, the wax may be looked upon as
adulterated with suet, or some similar substance.</p>

<p>The average <i>quantity yielded by a common hive</i>,
is about half a pound of wax to fifteen pounds of
honey; the quantity of both may be considerably
increased by storifying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White wax</span> is nothing more than the yellow
wax that has been exposed in thin flakes or
shreds to the action of the sun and air. There
is an apparatus for melting and reducing the wax
into shreds or ribbands, but the process of conversion,
under any circumstances, is tedious and
dependent on the weather. &ldquo;The following,&rdquo;
says Mr. Parkes in his Chemical Essays, &ldquo;is the
usual process, as it is conducted in England.
Common bees-wax is melted upon hot water; and
when in a fluid state, it is laded out of the copper,
together with a part of the water, into a wooden
vessel; and in this it is allowed to remain a few
hours, for the impurities to subside from it. The
purified wax is then put, while still hot, into a
cullender full of holes, through which it runs, and
falls upon a revolving metallic roller, which dips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">- 222 -</a></span>
into cold water contained in a vessel placed
underneath. As the melted wax runs through the
cullender upon the revolving roller, the motion of
the cylinder forms it into thin shavings, which
cool as they come in contact with the water, and
fall in an accumulated heap into the water below.
These shavings of wax, being now in a suitable
form for absorbing oxygen, are taken out of the
tub, and exposed in a field to the action of the
atmosphere, till they become sufficiently white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bees-wax forms <i>a considerable article of commerce</i>,
and large quantities of it are annually imported
into this country from the Baltic, the
Levant, the Barbary Coast, and North America.
In some parts of Europe and America wax is very
extensively employed in the religious ceremonies
of the inhabitants. Humboldt informs us that
upwards of 80,000 pounds worth is annually imported
from Cuba to New Spain, and that the
total export from that island in 1803 was worth
upwards of 130,000<i>l.</i> By far the greater part of
this wax is the produce of the hive-bee, though
no inconsiderable quantity is procured also from
various species of wild bees, as well as from
certain trees which I shall notice presently.</p>

<p>Upon this subject a modern writer, after lamenting
the increasing neglect of bee-culture in
this country, has not hesitated to use the following
contemptuous, though somewhat extravagant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">- 223 -</a></span>
language. &ldquo;There is hardly bees-wax enough
produced in England to answer the demand for
lip-salve alone; but importation from America
supplies all our wants, for the quantity obtained
in that country is annually increasing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Little
thinks the ball-room beauty, when the tapers are
almost burnt out, that the wax by whose light her
charms have been exalted was once hidden in
the bells and cups of innumerable flowers, shedding
perfume over the silent valleys of the Susquehanna,
or nodding at their own reflected colours
in the waters of the Potomac and Delaware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The uses of wax in making candles, ointments,
&amp;c. are well known.</p>

<p>According to Buffon, the bees-wax of tropical
climates is too soft for any but medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>There is a species of <i>wax</i>, which is generally regarded
as <i>of vegetable origin</i>, and which is afforded
by various trees, plants and fruits. The light down
which silvers over the surface of prunes and other
stone fruits, has been shown by M. Proust to be
wax, the leaves and stem of the <i>Ceroxylon</i> also,
afford it in considerable quantity, if bruised and
boiled in water; but the trees which afford it in
greatest abundance, are the <i>Myrica cerifera angustifolia</i>
or wax-tree of Louisiana, and the <i>Myrica
cerifera latifolia</i> of Pennsylvania, Carolina, and
Virginia. The latter is now naturalized in France:
it flourishes also in the dry lands of Prussia, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">- 224 -</a></span>
from the productiveness of its berries, it seems
surprising that its culture is not more general.</p>

<p>The mode in which this <i>myrtle wax</i> is obtained
is as follows. Towards the end of autumn the
natives gather the ripe berries, boil them in water,
skim off the wax which rises, strain it off from its
impurities, and set it to drain, after which, they
remelt and form it into masses. Four pounds of
berries yield about one pound of wax.</p>

<p>From the wax thus procured, they make soap
and candles. The soap manufactured from it is
said to be excellent, and to wash linen perfectly
white; the candles afford a good light, without
smoke or guttering; their perfume is highly
agreeable, not only during the time that they are
burning, but for a considerable time afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Sparrman suspects that myrtle wax is deposited
upon the berries by insects, and Du Valde
has given an account of a white wax made by
small insects, round the branches of a tree in
China, in great quantity, which is there collected
for medical and economical purposes. (Description
of China, vol. i. page 230.) Myrtle wax
therefore may not be a vegetable product.</p>

<p>According to the experiments of M. Cadet and
Dr. Bostock, this <i>myrtle wax differs in some respects
from, bees-wax</i>. It differs from it in colour,
different specimens of it assuming different shades
of yellowish green: its smell is also different;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">- 225 -</a></span>
myrtle wax, when fresh, emitting a fragrant balsamic
odour. It has in part the tenacity without
the unctuosity of bees-wax, and somewhat of the
brittleness of resin. Its specific gravity is greater,
insomuch that it sinks in water, whereas bees-wax
floats upon it; and it is not so easily bleached to
form white wax.</p>

<p class="caption2">HONEY.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">H</span>oney</span> is a well known, sweet, tenacious, substance,
which in fine weather is continually secreting
in the nectaries of flowers, chiefly from
certain vesicles or glands situated near the basis
of every petal, from whence it is collected by bees
and other insects. The domestic honey-bees
consume a portion of this honey for food, at or
near the time of gathering; but the principal part
is regurgitated and poured into the cells of the
hive, for the use of the community in winter:&mdash;so
very abundant are these collections, in favourable
seasons, as to afford to the apiarian an extensive
share of them, without distressing the provident
hoarders. Mr. Wildman states that in the year
1789, he purchased a glass filled with exceedingly
fine honey-combs, weighing 63lbs., which had been
collected within a month, and that the hive which
it had surmounted still contained a full supply
for the winter&rsquo;s consumption of the bees. This
however was an unusual quantity; a hive or box,
of the dimensions recommended in this work, may
be considered as well stocked when it yields from
30 to 40lbs. of honey.</p>

<p>The honey intended for early use, and for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">- 227 -</a></span>
nursing-bees and drones, is deposited in cells
which are allowed to remain open, and is probably
of an inferior sort; whilst the finest honey, which
is laid up in store for winter, is placed in the
most inaccessible parts of the hive, and closed in
the cells with waxen lids.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There cluster&rsquo;d now clear wells of nectar glow,<br /></span>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>In the Philosophical Transactions for 1792,
Mr. Hunter has stated, that whatever time the
contents of the honey-bags may be retained, they
still remain pure and unaltered by the digestive
process. Mr. Polhill, a gentleman to whom the
public are indebted for several articles in Rees&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia appertaining to bees, is also of this
opinion. Messrs. Kirby and Spence do not admit
this statement: as the nectar of flowers is not
of so thick a consistence as honey, they think <i>it
must undergo some change in the stomach of the
bee</i>. This opinion is strengthened by what has been
stated by Reaumur: he observed that if there was
a deficiency of flowers, at the season of honey-gathering,
and the bees were furnished with sugar,
they filled their cells with honey, differing in no
other respect from honey collected in the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">- 228 -</a></span>
way, but in its possessing a somewhat higher
flavour and in its never
candying, nor even losing its fluidity by
long keeping. The same may be observed when they
imbibe the juices of sweet fruits, for bees do not
confine themselves solely to flowers and honey-dewed
leaves; they will sometimes very greedily
absorb the juice of raspberries for instance, and
thus spoil them for the table; they also visit in
crowds the vats of the cider and wine maker.</p>

<p>Reaumur has likewise remarked, that <i>in each
honey-cell there is a cream-like layer or covering,
of a thicker consistence than the honey itself</i>, which
apparently serves to retain the more liquid collections
that may from time to time be introduced
under it. Messrs. Kirby and Spence say, that if
honey were the unaltered nectar of flowers, it
would be difficult to conceive how this cream
could be collected in proper proportions. This
observation is made, in consequence of their presuming
that some of this cream-like covering is
conveyed into the cells with each deposition of
fresh honey; and it has been supposed that this
cream was the last portion disgorged. According
to an article in Rees&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, probably written
by Mr. Polhill, this cream-like matter is formed
at the very first, and every addition of honey is
deposited beneath it. The bee, entering into the
cell as deeply as possible, puts forward its anterior
pair of legs, and with them pierces a hole through
the crust or cream: while this hole is kept open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">- 229 -</a></span>
by the feet, the bee disgorges the honey in large
drops from its mouth; these, falling into the hole,
mix with the mass below: the bee, before it flies
off, new-models the crust, and closes up the hole.
This mode of proceeding is regularly adopted by
every bee that contributes to the general store.</p>

<p>The power of <i>regurgitation</i> in the bee is very
remarkable: its alimentary organs, like those of
the pigeon, besides being subservient to the purpose
of nutriment, afford it a temporary storeroom
or reservoir. Ruminating animals may be
considered as regurgitating animals, though in
them the operation is performed for different purposes.
In some it is exercised for the purpose
of digesting the food, in others for feeding the
young; but in bees its use is to enable them to
disburden themselves of the honey which they
gather for the winter&rsquo;s store of the community.</p>

<p><i>The finest flavoured</i> and most delicate <i>honey</i> is
that which <i>is collected from aromatic plants</i>, and
has been stored in clean new cells: it has been
usually called <i>virgin-honey</i>, as though it were
elaborated by a fresh swarm of bees; but this
is not essential to the perfection of honey, for,
provided the cells in which it is deposited have
never contained either brood or farina, it is not
material whether it have been collected by swarms
or by old stocks; the season and the flowers
having been the same, the quality of the honey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">- 230 -</a></span>
will in both cases be alike. F. Lamberti asserts,
that the best honey in the world is produced in
Pontus, and that its superiority is attributable to
the great quantity of balm growing there. In
this quarter of the world, the <i>Narbonne honey</i> is
regarded as the finest, owing to the rosemary
which abounds in the neighbourhood of Narbonne.
&ldquo;The honey, for which <i>Narbonne</i> is so deservedly
celebrated, is every year diminishing. Bees have
ceased to be an object of attention to the peasantry;
they now devote their time to the vineyards,
and neglect the bees. The flowers of the wild
plants, in the neighbourhood of Narbonne, are
highly aromatic, and give the flavour which is
peculiar to its honey: this peculiarity is attributed
exclusively to the wild rosemary, <i>Rosmarinus
officinalis</i>.&rdquo; (Duppa&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Observations
and Opinions on the Continent. 1825.) Attempts
are said to have been made to imitate Narbonne
honey, by adding to other honey an infusion of
rosemary flowers.</p>

<p>Of the power which some flowers possess of imparting
deleterious qualities to their honey, I have
already spoken in the chapter on Pasturage. I will
here add, however, what has been said of the appearance
of this <i>pernicious</i> kind of <i>honey</i>. It is
usually distinguished from what is innocent, by
its crimson or reddish brown colour, its bitter
flavour, and thicker consistence; but in Florida
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">- 231 -</a></span>
and Carolina it is so similar, in all respects, to
innocent honey, that the hunters depend upon
experience only, and, knowing that bad honey
soon shows its effects, they at first eat very sparingly.
The converse of this would appear in the
&ldquo;blood-red honey&rdquo; found by Mr. Bruce at Dixan
in Abyssinia, to which he ascribes no evil properties.
(Travels to the Nile, vol. v.) Linn&aelig;us informs
us, that in Sweden, the honey of autumn is
principally gathered from the flowers of the <i>Erica</i>
or Heath, and that it has a reddish cast. The
honey of our native heaths is also of the same
colour. Dr. Barton has observed that during his
residence at Edinburgh, the Highland honey was
often of a dirty brownish colour, which was supposed
to be given to it by the &ldquo;blooming hather,&rdquo;
as Burns calls it: the people of Edinburgh, however,
though great consumers of it, never complain
of any ill effects from it. It produced upon the
Doctor a soporific effect. The most innocent
honey will often disagree with those who take it
in large quantities, or who have irritable bowels;
usually, in such cases, it produces purging, and
sometimes griping pain. The mischievous qualities
of honey have been said to be destroyed by
boiling and straining, or even by long keeping
only; yet when made into metheglin, it has
been found as deleterious as ever.</p>

<p><i>The quality of honey varies with the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">- 232 -</a></span>
gathering</i>, and that even though the whole season
may have been favourable. The collection at
the commencement of summer is regarded as the
prime honey of the year, the flowers being then
most abundant, and in the full glow of health; and
that which is collected in spring is superior to the
gleanings of autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huber</span> states that <i>the secretion of honey and the
formation of wax are singularly promoted by electricity</i>:
hence the works may always be observed
to advance rapidly when there is a southerly
wind, a moist warm air, and an impending storm;
whereas the secretion is impeded, and sometimes
suspended, by long protracted droughts, cold rains,
and a northerly wind.</p>

<p><i>Prime honey</i> is of a whitish colour, an agreeable
smell, a pleasant taste, and a thick consistence.
When taken from the combs it is in a fluid state,
but gradually thickens by age, and in cold weather,
if genuine, it becomes firm and solid. In England,
it has seldom, if ever, been known to assume this
solid state while in the hives; and even out of
them, if it remain in the combs, it will preserve its
clearness, purity and fine flavour, for at least a
year. The honey of tropical climates is always
in a fluid state. <i>Vide</i> chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVI">Exotic Bees</a>.</p>

<p><i>Much of the fine flavour of honey will depend
upon the manner of its separation from the comb.</i>
That will be the most delicate which flows spontaneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">- 233 -</a></span>
from the purest and whitest combs; the
next in excellence will be that which is expressed
without heat; and the coarsest, that which is obtained
by the aid of heat and pressure.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in the selection of <i>the
vessels used for storing honey;</i> the most appropriate
are <i>jars of stone ware</i>, called Bristol ware. The
principal <i>constituents of sugar and honey</i> are the
same; viz. hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Besides
these their common elements, honey contains mucilage
and extractive matter, and also an excess of
oxygen: in plain English, honey possesses a greater
proportion of acid than is contained in sugar, and
in a state more capable of acting upon those
bodies with which it comes in contact. From
this the reader will perceive my reason for recommending
stone jars for its preservation: the acid
of the honey acting upon the lead with which every
other kind of earthenware is glazed, causes the
honey to receive an impregnation from it, which
may prove injurious to those whose constitutions
are delicate: the stone ware, being glazed with
common salt, cannot communicate any injurious
property to the honey which is stored in it. <i>Honey
should be kept in a cool and dry situation</i>, as
warmth promotes fermentation and generates a
sensible acidity. The circumstance of honey,
when separated from the combs and put into jars,
being disposed to ferment in a temperature much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">- 234 -</a></span>
below the usual heat of a hive, is calculated to
excite our admiration of the instinctive intelligence
of the bee, which leads it to distribute its treasure
in small cells and to seal them closely over,
whereby the honey can be preserved from fermentation
for a long period, even in a high temperature.
<span class="smcap">Proust</span> <i>says that granulated honey is capable
of being separated into two parts</i>, one of
which is liquid, the other dry and not deliquescent,
crystallizable in its manner and less saccharine than
sugar. <i>The Jews of Moldavia and the Ukraine
prepare from honey a sort of sugar</i> which is solid
and as white as snow, which they send to the
distilleries at Dantzic. They expose the honey
to frost for three weeks, in some place where
neither sun nor snow can reach it, and in a vessel
which is a bad conductor of caloric, by which
process the honey, without being congealed, becomes
clear and hard like sugar.</p>

<p>Prior to the discovery of sugar, honey must
have been an article of great utility; and notwithstanding
that discovery, if we may judge from the
quantity imported into this country, and the price
at which it sells when of fine quality, it may still
be regarded as a commodity of great importance,
and worthy of more attention from our rural
population than it in general obtains. <i>In the
Ukraine, some of the peasants have four or five
hundred hives each, and find their bees more profitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">- 235 -</a></span>
than their corn.</i> This is a number however
which I should think would overstock most districts,
and which could only be supported naturally
by having recourse to transportation. This seems
to be evinced by the inhabitants of Egypt, France,
Savoy, Piedmont and other places availing themselves
of that practice, as already stated.</p>

<p>The most productive parts of this kingdom, in
all probability, are the borders of Cambridgeshire,
Hertfordshire, and part of Hampshire, which
abounding in heaths, commons and woods, afford
so much pabulum for bees, as to enable some of
the farmers to have from 100 to 150 stocks of
them, the largest number that I have ever heard
of in this kingdom.</p>

<p>On the subject of <i>overstocking</i>, Mr. Espinasse
says that few parts of England which he has
visited afford flowers in sufficient profusion and
of sufficient variety to support numerous colonies.
&ldquo;In the village,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;where my house is
situated, many persons, induced by my example,
procured bees; they were too numerous for what
was to feed them; more than one half of them
died in the ensuing winter, and nearly one-third
of my own were with difficulty saved by feeding.&rdquo;
The proprietor of bees may know whether or
not his situation is overstocked, if he will attend
to the produce of his apiary for several years
together.</p>

<p class="caption2">MEAD.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">P</span>rior</span> to the introduction of agriculture into Britain,
mead was the principal cordial beverage of
its inhabitants. In other northern nations also
it was formerly in high estimation. This must
have proceeded, either from their unpampered
simplicity of taste, or from their having a better
method of making their mead than has been
handed down to posterity; for certainly in the
present day it is a liquor seldom heard of, and
still seldomer made; and when made, holding a
very humble rank among our imperfect vinous
productions. It however continued in favour
long after the introduction of malt liquor, and
the northern inhabitants of Europe drank it generally
until very modern times. To show how highly
it was formerly esteemed in this country, I will
give an extract from an ancient law of the principality
of Wales, where &ldquo;the praises of it, accompanied
by the lyre, resounded through the spacious
halls of her princes.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are three things
in Court which must be communicated to the
king, before they are made known to any other
person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">- 237 -</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;1st, Every sentence of the judge;</p>

<p>2nd, Every new song; and</p>

<p>3rd, Every cask of Mead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mead-making appears to have been regarded
by our forefathers as a high and important avocation;
at the courts of the Princes of Wales,
the mead-maker was the eleventh person in dignity,
and took place of the physician. We read
in the English History, that Ethelstan a subordinate
king of Kent, in the tenth century, on
paying a visit to his relation Ethelfleda felt very
much delighted that there was no deficiency of
mead. According to the custom at royal feasts,
it was served up in cut horns and other vessels of
various sizes. About the same period, it was
customary to allow the monks a sextareum (about
a pint) of mead between six of them at dinner,
and half the quantity at supper.</p>

<p>It was probably the liquor called by Ossian,
the joy and strength of shells, with which his
heroes were so much delighted; the Caledonian
drinking-vessels having consisted of large shells,
which are still used by their posterity in some
parts of the Highlands. Mention is sometimes
made also of the Feast of Shells.</p>

<p>Mead was the ideal nectar of the Scandinavian
nations, which they expected to quaff in heaven out
of the skulls of their enemies; and, as may reasonably
be supposed, the liquor which they exalted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">- 238 -</a></span>
thus highly in their <i>imaginary celestial banquets</i>,
was not forgotten at those which they <i>really</i> indulged
in <i>upon earth</i>. Hence may be inferred
the great attention which must have been paid
to the culture of the bee in those days, or there
could not have been an adequate supply of honey
for the production of mead, to satisfy the demand
of such thirsty tribes.</p>

<p>The mythology of Scandinavia (the religion of
our Gothic ancestors) was imparted by Sigge or
Odin, a chieftain who migrated from Scythia with
the whole of his tribe, and subdued either by arms
or arts the northern parts of Europe. From him
descended Alaric and Attila. In the singular
paradise which Odin sketched for his followers,
the principal pleasure was to be derived from war
and carnage; after the daily enjoyment of which,
they were to sit down to a feast of boar&rsquo;s flesh
and mead. The mead was to be handed to them
in the skulls of their enemies, by virgins somewhat
resembling the houri of the Mahometan paradise,
and plentiful draughts were to be taken,
until intoxication should crown their felicity.
Hence the poet <span class="smcap">Penrose</span> thus commences his
&ldquo;Carousal of Odin.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fill the honey&rsquo;d bev&rsquo;rage high,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Hence likewise, in an ode by <span class="smcap">Mr. Stirling</span>, we
find the following illustration of the northern Elysium.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Their banquet is the mighty chine<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of heroes&rsquo; skulls the goblet made,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With figur&rsquo;d deaths and snakes of gold inlaid.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Boar&rsquo;s flesh was considered by these tribes as
the highest delicacy; the celestial boar was supposed
to be daily renewed, and to afford an ample
repast for the most numerous party: a quantity
of mead also, sufficient for the intoxication of
this paradisiacal community, was imagined to be
daily supplied by a goat called Heidruna,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Whose spacious horn would fill the bowl<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Still the copious stream supply.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Cottle.</span></p></div>

<p>I could not refrain from adducing these short
historical and poetical evidences of the high estimation
in which mead was held by our northern
ancestors. I trust that I shall also stand excused
for still further lengthening my preamble by entering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">- 240 -</a></span>
upon <i>the general principles of wine-making</i>.</p>

<p><i>The grand desiderata in wine are strength,
flavour, and pleasantness:</i>&mdash;to accomplish the first,
sugar must be converted by fermentation into
alcohol; the second depends upon the article to be
vinified, and upon the management of the process
of vinification; flavour may likewise be produced
artificially by different adjuncts: pleasantness will
principally result from the same causes, but more
especially from the liquor holding in solution a
certain quantity of unconverted sugar.</p>

<p><i>The elements necessary to a due fermentation</i>
and to bring the process to a satisfactory issue,
<i>are sugar, extractive matter, acid of tartar</i>, and
<i>water</i>. These exist in the highest perfection and
in the best relative proportions in <i>the grape</i>: hence
the superiority of foreign wines. Whoever therefore
expects to imitate, with much effect, those
generous liquors, must supply in the process those
ingredients in which the article sought to be converted
into wine is deficient.</p>

<p>If the native juices of fruits be deficient in sugar,
it will be impossible to convert them into a strong
wine without a proper supply of that ingredient;
and without a sufficiency of extractive matter,
which is the natural ferment, a due fermentation
could not be established; the wine would be sweet,
but not potent; <i>sweet wines being the produce of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">- 241 -</a></span>
an incomplete fermentation</i>. If the extractive
matter were in excess, the liquor would have a
tendency to the acetous fermentation, which might
also be induced by a superabundant proportion of
water.</p>

<p><i>The result of a complete fermentation is a dry
wine;</i> to produce which, the elements must all be
nicely balanced, and the process conducted under
favourable circumstances, with respect to temperature,
tunning, stopping down, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Two opposite practices prevail, in the manufacture
of the same sort of wine; <i>some wine-makers
boiling the juices before fermentation, others conducting
the whole process without boiling:</i> the propriety
or impropriety of these practices depends
upon the quality of the juices to be vinified. Extractive
matter is partially coagulable by heat;
boiling therefore, by causing this matter to separate
and to be deposited, tends to the production
of a sweet wine. The extractive matter may
also be precipitated by sulphuric acid gas, (burning
in the cask a brimstone match as hereafter
directed,) or by sulphuric acid itself, with which
the soluble leaven forms an insoluble compound.
Hence where the extractive matter is in excess,
and where there is danger of fermentation going
on too rapidly, boiling or sulphuring will be useful
both to the wine and cider-maker, in checking or
preventing fermentation. The superfluous extract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">- 242 -</a></span>
thrown up in the course of fermentation as
yeast, or deposited as lees, will, if remixed with
the liquor, have the effect of continuing the fermentation:
hence the utility of racking and fining,
where it is in excess; and of re-union, where it is
deficient. <i>Artificial leaven or yeast</i>, which contains
the extractive principle in great abundance,
affords a supply to those juices which are deficient
in it, and without which they will not ferment.
<i>Natural leaven</i> (i. e. <i>extractive matter</i>) is soluble
in cold water, artificial leaven is not: during fermentation,
therefore, the latter is always thrown
off; so also is the greater part of the former, if the
process be well conducted.</p>

<p>Most of the fruits of this country abound in
<i>malic acid</i>; those that possess only a moderate
quantity of it, however, afford excellent wine with
the addition of sugar only; still better wine may
be obtained by the further addition of the acid of
tartar. Where the malic acid prevails so abundantly
as to make its neutralization desirable.
<span class="smcap">Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Culloch</span>, (to whom I am indebted for
much of the information contained in this chapter,)
recommends the coating of the insides of the fermenting
vats with a white wash of hot <i>caustic
lime</i>. I have neutralized the malic acid, by putting
into the cask, after the sensible fermentation has
been completed, about a pound of <i>egg shells</i> to
every sixty gallons of wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">- 243 -</a></span></p>

<p>The acid of tartar increases the fermenting
power of fluids: half-ripe fruits possess it in
greatest abundance; hence the vivacity of champagne
and green gooseberry wine. It is most conveniently
used in the state of supertartrate of
potash or common cream of tartar: the common
rough tartar is in some respects preferable, as
its admixture of yeast assists in perfecting the
fermentation.</p>

<p>All vegetables contain more or less of extractive
matter; those that possess little may be assisted
in their fermentation, by that process being conducted
in wooden vessels, wood supplying the
extractive principle to the liquor; the same juices
therefore which would ferment very well in wood,
would scarcely ferment at all in glass or earthenware.</p>

<p>The extractive matter and the sugar are seldom
completely destroyed in any wines; the existence
of the former is evinced, by the skinny matter
frequently deposited upon the insides of the wine-bottles;
the latter may be detected, by a nice
palate, in the very driest of our wines; its predominance
indicates an inferior wine.</p>

<p>From the preceding observations, my readers
have probably anticipated my opinion of <i>honey,
in wine-making</i>. I regard it merely as <i>a substitute
for sugar</i>; and to those who approve of its flavour
I recommend the following <i>directions</i>, which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">- 244 -</a></span>
have successfully followed for several years,
having my home-made wines enriched with a
considerable portion of foreign flavour.&mdash;Dissolve
an ounce of cream of tartar in five gallons
of boiling water; pour the solution off clear upon
twenty pounds of fine honey, boil them together
and remove the scum as it rises. Towards the
end of the boiling, add an ounce of fine hops;
about ten minutes afterwards, put the liquor into
a tub to cool; when reduced to the temperature
of about 60&deg; Fahrenheit, add a slice of bread
toasted and smeared over with a very little yeast;
the smaller the quantity the better, for <i>yeast invariably
spoils the flavour of wines</i>, and where
there is a sufficiency of extractive matter in the
ingredients employed, it should never be introduced.
The liquor should now stand, and be
stirred occasionally, till it carries a head, when it
should be tunned and the cask filled up from time
to time from the reserve, till the fermentation
has nearly subsided. It should now be bunged
down, leaving open a small peg-hole; in a few days
this may also be closed, and in about twelve
months the wine will be fit to bottle.</p>

<p>Many makers of both wine and cider have been
unconsciously benefited from the acquisition of
tartar by their liquor; it being a frequent practice
to tun into an empty foreign wine cask, whose
incrusted sides have supplied their wine or their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">- 245 -</a></span>
cider with a portion of that necessary ingredient
for perfect vinification.</p>

<p>It is a practice with some to add <i>spices</i> to their
Mead during the fermentation, such as ginger,
cloves, mace, rosemary, lemon-peel, &amp;c. This
is bad &#339;conomy; a much smaller quantity will
communicate the required flavour if the addition
be made after the fermentation has ceased.</p>

<p>A <i>common beverage</i> is sometimes made, by
simply boiling the refuse honey-combs in water
after extracting from them as much of the honey
as will run; this liquor will not require tartar or
yeast: it should be tunned as soon as cool, bunged
down in three or four days, and drank in a few
weeks. In some parts of Wales the refuse combs
are brewed with malt, spices, &amp;c. and the produce
is called <i>Braggot</i>, a name derived from the old
British words <i>brag</i> and <i>gots</i>, the former signifying
<i>malt</i>, the latter <i>honey-comb</i>.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the principles of fermentation
will enable the wine-maker to regulate its process.
Thus if a dry wine be desired, and fermentation
be suspended, it may be renewed by a restoration
of the separated leaven or the addition of fresh;
or by agitation and a remixture of the lees. It
is upon the latter principle, called &ldquo;<i>feeding on the
lees</i>,&rdquo; that some foreign wines are improved by
long voyages; but this treatment, so <i>serviceable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">- 246 -</a></span>
to Madeira and other Spanish wines</i>, and also to
some of the French wines, <i>would destroy Burgundy</i>.
If there be an excess of fermentation the scientific
operator will regulate, check or suspend it, by
skimming, racking, fining. If skimming and racking
do not succeed, recourse must be had to
<i>fining</i>, which may be effected <i>by isinglass</i>, in the
proportion of about an ounce to 100 gallons.
The isinglass must be beaten, for a few days, with
a whisk in a small quantity of the wine, till completely
attenuated. This solution must then be
well stirred into the cask of wine, which in about
a week will become fine and fit for being racked
off. This fining is accomplished by the union of
the isinglass with what is called the tannin of the
wine. Fining may also be effected by <i>stumming</i>,
i. e. <i>by burning in a close vessel containing a small
part of the wine a brimstone rag</i>, at the rate of a
dram of sulphur to thirty gallons; and when consumed,
rolling the cask about for a quarter of an
hour, that the wine may absorb as much as possible
of the sulphuric acid gas. This being done,
the cask is to be filled up with the remainder of
the wine, and bunged down. In this process the
sulphuric acid or its oxygen unites with the extractive
matter or soluble leaven, which being
thereby rendered insoluble is precipitated to the
bottom, as I before observed. If wines be perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">- 247 -</a></span>
fermented, they do not require the addition
of any brandy, as a sufficiency of spirit is generated
during the process.</p>

<p><i>The best temperature for carrying on fermentation</i>
is about 54&deg; Fahrenheit. Its perfection depends in
some degree upon the volume of the liquor; the
larger the quantity, the longer the fermentation
will continue, and the stronger and pleasanter
will be the wine. There are however exceptions
to this rule. The peculiar excellence of champagne
would be destroyed, if its fermentation were
conducted upon a large scale: it may be made
successfully in a gallon measure. This wine is so
managed by the makers as to ferment after
bottling.</p>

<p><i>Dry wines and fine wines</i> are much more durable
than any others; and those that would perish in
cask, <i>may be preserved many years by bottling</i>.</p>

<p>These hints will, I hope, enable the makers of
home-made wines to conduct the process scientifically,
and to secure generally a successful issue.
Cookery books and good housewives abound in
receipts for wine-making, which are very often
fanciful and absurd, recommending the introduction
of articles which, in their very natures,
counteract the production of good wine. Hence
we are sometimes presented with such miserable
mawkish stuff, as disgraces the name of wine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">- 248 -</a></span>
being only rendered tolerable by the brandy which
has been added to it, and which in some degree
covers the crudeness and insipidity of the compound,
and moderates its hostility to the peace of
our stomachs.</p>

<p>These are connected together by ligaments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Head</span>, in common with that of other
creatures, is the inlet for nutrition and the principal
seat of the organs of sensation.&mdash;Of nutrition
and sensation I shall speak in their appropriate
places.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Trunk</span> is the intermediate section of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">- 251 -</a></span>
body between the head and the abdomen: it
approaches in figure to a sphere, and is the seat
of the organs of motion; it contains the muscles of
the wings and legs which proceed from it, and is
the main prop, or as it were the key-stone, of the
other two sections. The upper side is called <i>thorax</i>
or the <i>chest</i>, the under side <i>pectus</i> or the <i>breast</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Abdomen</span> is the third section of the body,
posterior to the trunk; it is divided into six rings
or segments, which, by sliding one over another,
serve to shorten or lengthen the body. It is the
seat of the organs of generation, and principally
of those connected with respiration; and contains
also the anus and the sting. The upper part is
called <i>tergum</i> or the <i>back</i>, the under side <i>venter</i>
or the <i>belly</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Head.</span></p>

<p>The most remarkable part of the head is the
<span class="smcap">Proboscis</span>, of which so good an account has been
given by <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> that I shall describe it nearly
in his words.</p>

<p>It is not so much the mere simplicity of nature,
which excites our wonder and admiration, as that
apparently complex structure, which operates with
all the ease of the simplest machinery. Of this
we have not a more striking instance than in the
proboscis of the labouring bee: though the component
parts of the proboscis are scarcely discernible
by the naked eye, yet are they far more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">- 252 -</a></span>
complicated than the elephant&rsquo;s stupendous trunk.
It consists of no less than five distinct branches;
namely, a central trunk, or tongue, and four horny
scales, tapering to a point, convex outwards and
concave towards the trunk; the two outer ones so
sheath the inner as to appear but one single tube:
by a joint in the middle they bend, or extend all at
once, carrying with them the unarticulated tongue,
which is cylindrical, and about the size of a man&rsquo;s
hair, and appears through a magnifier to be composed
of successive rings. It has probably as many
short muscles as the tongue of a fish, which are capable
of moving it in all directions; and towards its
termination is furnished with hairs or villi, some
of which at the point are very long, and seem to act
like capillary tubes. <span class="smcap">Mr. Wildman</span> assures us,
that he has seen the trunk growing bigger and
less by turns, swelling the instant the bee sucked;
and this alternate lessening and enlargement propagated
from the extremity to the root. What a
delicate apparatus of invisible muscles must perform
this office! The tongue is capable of being
contracted and folded up at pleasure; for if it
were constantly extended, it would be exposed to
injury: when at rest, therefore, it is doubled up by
means of its joint, and lies in a very small compass;
the first portion being brought within the
lip, and the second part folded under the head
and neck, protection is given to it by a double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">- 253 -</a></span>
sheath, consisting of four strong scales, the two
inner scales sheathing the tongue, and the two
outer and larger ones encompassing the whole.
When at work, the trunk is lengthened beyond
its sheaths, probes the very bottom of the flowers,
through all impediments of foliage or fructification,
and drains them of those treasured sweets which,
without such an apparatus, would be completely
inaccessible.</p>

<p>The proboscis of the bee is not used like that
of other flies, not being tubular like theirs, but
serves as a brush or besom to sweep, or as a
tongue to lap<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>; having collected the nectar of
flowers in small drops, it deposits its collection
upon the tongue, which is protruded for the purpose
of receiving it, and having received it, withdrawn
again.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> The bee and all other insects that lap their food are

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lips</span>. The bee has two lips, an upper one
called <i>labrum</i>, and an under one called <i>labium</i>;
(the <i>Mentum</i> of Latreille.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tongue</span> of the bee, which is very long, is
at its upper part cartilaginous; below the middle,
membranous and capable of considerable inflation,
thus forming a bag to receive the honey from the
proboscis, preparatory to its conveyance into the
pharynx. It terminates in a knob, but has no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">- 254 -</a></span>passage through it, to exercise the power of suction,
as has been supposed. When in a state of
inaction, it is folded up longitudinally, and lies
between the lips. The tongue of the working
bee is probably the largest of any known animal,
for its size; it is much longer than that of either
the male or queen, and thus fitted for taking up
honey at a considerable depth. The bee has the
power of unfolding it with great rapidity, and
darting it betwixt the petals and stamina of those
flowers that afford honey, it moves it about in
every direction, sweeping the convex as well as
the concave surface of the petals.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pharynx</span> lies at the root of the tongue;
it is an opening by which the honey passes from
the tongue to the gullet or honey-bag, and closes
by a valve.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">&#338;sophagus</span> or <span class="smcap">Gullet</span> receives the food
from the pharynx, and conveys it, in part at least,
to the stomach, there to be digested, animalized,
and forwarded to the small intestines, from whence
it is distributed, through appropriate vessels or
tubes, to all parts of the body for its nutriment.
The gullet is long and slender, commences at the
termination of the pharynx, and traversing the
neck and breast, dilates into a fine bag, transparent
as crystal, and when filled with honey about the
size of a small pea. In bees caught on going out
early in the morning, Mr. Hunter found this reservoir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">- 255 -</a></span>
perfectly empty; but in those returning
from the fields, it was quite full of honey, <i>some</i>
of which had passed into the stomach.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mandibles</span> or upper jaws move horizontally,
and are armed with teeth.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Maxill&aelig;</span> or under jaws are situated below
the mandibles, have a similar motion, and form,
according to Linn&aelig;us, the sheath of the tongue.
De Geer regarded them as part of the apparatus
of the under lip, on each side of which they are
placed.</p>

<p>The mandibles are powerful organs, hard and
horny, and constitute the tools with which the bee
performs its various labours; the maxill&aelig; on the
contrary are soft and leathery: the latter probably
serve to hold such materials as the former
have occasion to operate upon.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Antenn&aelig;</span>. Of all the organs of insects,
none appear to be of more importance than their
antenn&aelig;: in all the tribe they are planted either
between or below the eyes; and no insect has
more than two: in their general structure, they
consist of a number of tubular joints, each having
a separate motion, which gives them every variety
of flexure. The antenn&aelig; of the male have one
more joint than those of the female, the former
having thirteen, the latter only twelve. They
seem to enable the insects, by certain signs and
gestures, to communicate to each other their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">- 256 -</a></span>
mutual wants or discoveries. But I shall enter
more fully into this subject when I come to speak
of the various uses to which the antenn&aelig; are
applied.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Palpi</span> or <span class="smcap">Feelers</span> are also important organs;
their ends are furnished with nervous
papill&aelig;, indicating some peculiar sense, of which
they are the instrument: they are four in number,
two emerging from the maxill&aelig; called maxillary
feelers, and one from each side of the labium,
called labial feelers. The maxillary are short
and without a joint, the labial long and with four
joints, including the two flat joints or elevators.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eyes</span>, two in number, are placed in the
sides of the head; they are compounds of an infinite
number of hexagonal lenses, as clear as
crystal, and are guarded by a horny tunicle or
covering. This subject is however treated of in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Chap. XXXII.</a></p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Trunk.</span></p>

<p>The trunk affords attachment to the organs of
motion.</p>

<p>First, To the <span class="smcap">Wings</span>, which transport the insect
through the air; these consist of two <i>superior</i> and
two <i>inferior</i>: they are membranous and transparent,
and while in a state of repose are incumbent
on each other, covering the abdomen.</p>

<p>Bees and various other hymenopterous insects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">- 257 -</a></span>
and also those of the dipterous family, possess
the power of flying in a more perfect degree than
any class of animals besides, surpassing in this
respect even the bird tribe. In the anterior margin
of the under wings small hooks (<i>hamuli</i>) are
placed, which are capable of laying hold of the
posterior margin of the upper wings, by means of
which they are kept steady when flying. These
hooks are discoverable under a good magnifier.</p>

<p>Secondly, To the <span class="smcap">Legs</span>, by which the insect
moves itself from place to place upon the earth.
Of these there are <i>six in number</i>, each composed
of several joints, and articulated like our arms,
thus affording the power of various movements:
in the legs are three distinct divisions; namely, the
thigh, the shank, and the foot. In the <i>four</i> hinder
legs one joint forms a kind of <i>brush</i>, externally
smooth and bare, but covered on the inside with
stiff bristling hairs. By these the insect is enabled
to brush off farina both from the tips of the stamina
of flowers and from the hairs of its own
body. With the jaws and two fore-feet, the meal
is rolled into small compact masses, which are conveyed,
by the middle pair of legs, to the <i>spoon-shaped
cavities</i> in the centre joint of the two hindmost
feet; these are surrounded by strong close
set hairs, to secure more firmly the precious burdens.
(No such groove is to be found in the legs
of either the queen-bee or drone.) <i>Each foot</i> terminates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">- 258 -</a></span>
in <i>two hooks</i>, with their points opposite to
each other, by means of which the bees suspend
themselves from the roofs or sides of the hives or
boxes, and hang from each other, in the form of
festoons, ropes, or cones. From the middle of
each pair of hooks proceeds a little thin <i>appendix</i>,
which is usually folded up; when unfolded it enables
the insects to fasten themselves to polished
surfaces, such as glass, &amp;c.: they probably also
use it for taking up small bodies, the pollen for
instance, which they thereby transmit to the hollows
of their hinder legs.</p>

<p>The trunk also gives origin to a number of
muscles, serving various purposes, which it would
lead me too much into detail to enter upon here.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Abdomen.</span></p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i>, besides various other parts, contains
the <i>honey-bag</i>, the <i>venom-bag</i>, and the <i>anus</i>,
which latter in the female comprehends the <i>ovipositor</i>
and <i>sting</i>: in the male it contains the
<i>organs of reproduction</i> but no sting, and of course
no ovipositor. For a particular account of these,
<i>vide</i> Organs of Reproduction further on.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Organs of Sensation.</span></p>

<p>We have an abundance of presumptive evidence
that bees are endowed with <i>sensation</i> and <i>perception</i>,
and that the excitement of these faculties is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">- 259 -</a></span>
communicated, through the medium of <i>nerves</i>, to
a common <i>sensorium</i>, though the latter was denied
to insects by Linn&aelig;us and other eminent naturalists.
Common sensation, however, does not
reside in the brain alone of insects, as in that of
warm-blooded animals, but in the spinal marrow
also; hence it is that bees and many other insects
exhibit signs of sensation after their heads have
been severed from their bodies. Some insects
exhibit these for a long time afterwards, the wasp
for instance; <span class="smcap">Lyonnet</span> informs us that he has
seen motion in the body of a wasp, three days
after its division from the head; and I have known
several instances of its inflicting wounds with its
sting, at least four-and-twenty hours after the
separation. The severed body will not only
move but walk, and sometimes even fly, at first
almost as actively without the head as with it.
The penetrating genius of <span class="smcap">Lord Bacon</span> afforded
him such illumination upon this subject, as to
enable him to approach very near to what is at
this day regarded as a correct statement of the
cause of this <i>protracted vitality</i> in mutilated insects.
&ldquo;They stirre,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a good while after their
heads are off, or that they be cut in pieces; which
is caused also for that their vital spirits are more
diffused throughout all their parts, and lesse confined
to organs than in perfect creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That insects have a real sensorium or brain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">- 260 -</a></span>
would seem to be proved by their having <i>memory</i>,
and a <i>capacity to receive instruction</i>, and <i>acquire
new habits</i>. Such functions in higher animals are
regarded as functions of a cerebral system. That
they are endowed with memory cannot well be
doubted. <span class="smcap">Huber</span> relates a remarkable instance
of it in bees, which illustrates what will hereafter
be said on their having a method of communicating
information to each other. &ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;had been placed in a window in autumn,
where the bees resorted to it in multitudes. It
was removed, and the shutters closed during
winter; but when opened again, on the return of
spring, the bees came back, though no honey was
there. Undoubtedly they remembered it, therefore
an interval of several weeks did not obliterate
the impression they had received.&rdquo; &ldquo;But the
most striking fact evincing the memory of bees
has been communicated to me,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Mr. Kirby</span>,
"by my intelligent friend <span class="smcap">Mr. W. Stickney</span>, of
<i>Ridgemont, Holderness</i>. About twenty years ago,
a swarm from one of this gentleman&rsquo;s hives took
possession of an opening beneath the tiles of his
house, whence, after remaining a few hours, they
were dislodged and hived. For many subsequent
years, when the hives descended from this stock
were about to swarm, a considerable party of
scouts were observed, for a few days before, to
be reconnoitring about the old hole under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">- 261 -</a></span>
tiles; and <i>Mr. Stickney</i> is persuaded, that if
suffered, they would have established themselves
there. He is certain that for eight years successively
the descendants of the very stock that
first took possession of the hole, frequented it as
above stated, and <i>not</i> those of any other swarms;
having constantly noticed them, and ascertained
that they were bees from the original hive by
powdering them, while about the tiles, with yellow
ochre, and watching their return. And even at
the present time, there are still seen every swarming
season about the tiles, bees, which <i>Mr. Stickney</i>
has no doubt are descendants from the original
stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some anecdotes of the spider prove that insects
are capable of instruction. <span class="smcap">M. Pelisson</span>, when he
was confined in the Bastille, tamed a spider, and
taught it to come for food at the sound of an
instrument. <i>A manufacturer</i> also, in an apartment
<i>at Paris</i>, fed 800 spiders, which became so
tame, that whenever he entered it, which he
usually did with a dish of flies, they immediately
came down to receive their food. That insects
are susceptible of a change of habits, or rather
that they may acquire civilized habits, if I may
say so, is shown by the domestication of bees,
and occasionally by that of ants and wasps.
<span class="smcap">Huber&rsquo;s</span> experiments, with leaf-hives, show the
existence of this faculty in an eminent degree, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">- 262 -</a></span>
he assures us that it renders the bees quite tame
and tractable.</p>

<p>Most physiologists, resting upon the evidence
of analogy, agree in attributing <i>five senses</i> to
insects: (<span class="smcap">Dr. Virey</span>, as will be seen further on,
ascribes to them <i>seven senses:</i>) though there is a
difference of opinion as to the organs by which
those senses are conveyed. The <i>antenn&aelig;</i> for instance,
have been regarded by some as the organs
of smell, by others as the organs of touch, and by a
third class as the organs of hearing. With the substitution
of taste forbearing, the same opinions have
been maintained respecting the <i>palpi;</i> nor can the
question even now be considered as settled. The
prevailing opinion seems to be, that the antenn&aelig;
are explorers or tactors, but that they are also
applied to other uses; the effects produced by
their excision indicate that they are organs of the
highest importance. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Senses of Bees</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span> notice the analogy
borne by antenn&aelig; to the ears of vertebrate animals,
such as their corresponding in number and standing
out from the head. No ether organ has been
found which can be supposed to represent the
ear<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>. And what I have said in another place, of
their constituting a sixth sense, has received some
countenance from the observations of those naturalists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">- 263 -</a></span>
&ldquo;I conceive,&rdquo; says Mr. K., &ldquo;that the
antenn&aelig;, by a peculiar structure, may collect notices
from the atmosphere, receive pulses or vibrations,
and communicate them to the sensorium, which,
[communications] though not precisely to be called
hearing, may answer the same purpose.&rdquo; Lehmann
calls the function of the antenn&aelig; aëroscepsy. A very
remarkable instance of the effect produced upon
them by sound, is adduced by the authors just
quoted, which one of them has thus related. &ldquo;A
little moth was reposing upon my window; I made
a quiet, not loud, but distinct noise: the nearest
antenna immediately moved towards me. I repeated
the noise at least a dozen times, and it
was followed every time by the same motion of
that organ; till at length the insect, being alarmed,
became agitated and violent in its motions. In
this instance, it could not be <i>touch</i>; since the
antenna was not applied to a surface, but directed
towards the quarter from which the sound came,
as if to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Marcel de Serres</span> thinks he has discovered an organ
of hearing in most insects, but does not state its situation.</p></div>

<p>That the antenn&aelig; should have been regarded
as organs of smell is not surprising when the proceedings
of the bees on visiting flowers are considered;
their first act is to introduce one of the
antenn&aelig;, but no further than the tip: this conduct
would naturally enough convey the idea of looking
or smelling for nectar; yet it does not at all
militate against the opinion that the antenn&aelig; are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">- 264 -</a></span>
transmitters of sound; the sense which they supply
may, in these little creatures, be so very fine, as
to enable them to hear the bursting of an anther,
or the exudation of nectar. The continual motion
of the antenn&aelig; of insects from side to side, when
they walk, conveys the idea that it is by their
means that they inform themselves of what is
going on in their immediate vicinity. The importance
of the antenn&aelig; may be inferred from their
very complicated structure. <span class="smcap">Mr. Kirby</span> has
observed, that in one species of <i>Apis</i> which he
examined, under a powerful magnifier, the ten
last joints of the antenn&aelig; appeared to be composed
of innumerable hexagons, and from this similarity
in their structure to the eyes (<i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Senses of
Bees</a>) he thought that they might serve a somewhat
analogous purpose.</p>

<p>What I have said with respect to the Senses of
Bees, in another place, will I think make it evident
that these insects possess an organ of smell, but
with respect to its situation naturalists differ.
<span class="smcap">Baster</span>, <span class="smcap">Lehmann</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>, consider the
spiracles as the organs of smell, as well as of
respiration: this opinion is founded upon the
notion that, without the inspiration of air, there
can be no smell; and that as insects are smaller
than the food they live upon, it would be of no
consequence to them where this sense was situated.
<span class="smcap">Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>, on the contrary, suppose that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">- 265 -</a></span>
it resides in some organ near the mouth: in other
parts of the animal creation certainly, that is its
situation; and as there seems to be a necessary
connection between smell and taste, analogy should
lead us to argue in favour of that opinion; but
though smell be usually accompanied by respiratory
organs, they may not be essentially necessary
to it; a bee may receive impressions from external
objects, in a manner which we cannot comprehend.
In confirmation of this opinion of <span class="smcap">Kirby</span> and
<span class="smcap">Spence</span>, we have the experiments of <span class="smcap">Huber</span>. It
seems that no odour is so unpleasant to insects as
that of oil of turpentine. <span class="smcap">M. Huber</span> having presented
this oil, on the point of a camel&rsquo;s hair pencil,
successively to every part of the abdomen, trunk
and head, it excited no uneasiness in the bee: he
then tried the eyes and antenn&aelig;, but with the
same result; yet as soon as he pointed it a little
above the insertion of the proboscis, near the
cavity of the mouth, the bee receded, became
agitated, clapped its wings, and would have taken
flight, had not the pencil been withdrawn. This
experiment was repeated with the turpentine and
other articles of penetrating odour, and with the
same effect; but when the mouths of several bees
were stopped with paste, no such consequences
ensued, on the contrary they traversed the impregnated
pencils without being at all annoyed
by them; even honey did not attract them. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">- 266 -</a></span>
these circumstances tend to prove that the site of
smelling is in or near the mouth.&mdash;This subject
will be resumed in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Chap. XXXII.</a></p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Organs of Respiration.</span></p>

<p>The respiration of bees is performed through
several little orifices, called <i>stigmata</i>, <i>spiracles</i>, or
<i>breathing pores</i>, situated in the sides of their
bodies, behind their wings. <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> was of
opinion that inspiration was performed through the
spiracles, and expiration through the mouth; but
<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> proved satisfactorily that neither inspiration
nor expiration takes place through the mouth.
The spiracles are connected with a system of air-vessels
called <i>trache&aelig;</i>, ramifying through every
part of the frame, and serving the purpose of
lungs. From the absence of lungs, <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> and
the ancients in general thought that insects did
not breathe. <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> may perhaps be excepted, for
he has observed that dipping bees in honey or
oil deprives them of life;&mdash;this immersion stops up
the mouths of the spiracles. Modern physiologists
have however incontestibly proved that they
do breathe. &ldquo;Life and flame,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>, &ldquo;have
this in common, that neither the one nor the other
can subsist without air; all living beings, from
man to the most minute vegetable, perish when
they are utterly deprived of that fluid.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Huber</span>
detected the existence of the stigmata or breathing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">- 267 -</a></span>
pores, by immersing different portions of a bee
in water, and finally by total immersion, upon
which he observed that bubbles of air attached
themselves for some time to the orifices of the
stigmata, which alternately appeared and receded,
till their increased bulk enabled them to overcome
the resistance of inspiration and rise to the surface.
These respiratory organs escaped the observation
of <span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span>.</p>

<p>Air is equally necessary to insects in the egg
state: <span class="smcap">Spallanzani</span> found that their eggs could
not be hatched in small close vessels, though all
other circumstances were favourable to a development.
The eggs of the hive-bee, whilst in the
ovaries, have a net-work of air-vessels spread
over their surfaces;&mdash;these were discovered by
Swammerdam: from analogy, we may reasonably
conclude, that such a provision obtains generally.</p>

<p>The closeness of a hive, and its having no
direct current of air through it, may favour a
belief that bees can exist in any atmosphere,
however vitiated, and may seem also to confirm
the opinion of the ancients, that they have no
particular system of respiratory organs. But
<span class="smcap">M. Huber</span> and <span class="smcap">Son</span> have proved that they breathe
like other animals, that they are speedily deprived
of life, if the process of respiration be arrested;
so delicate indeed is their organization, that they
detect the smallest deterioration in the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">- 268 -</a></span>
of their hives, and immediately adopt measures to
restore to this element the degree of purity
essential to respiration: from some eudiometrical
experiments, it has been ascertained that the air
of a well stocked hive is as pure as that by which
it is surrounded. Still neither wax nor pollen
favours the generation of oxygen gas, nor have
bees the faculty of generating it; for when very
closely shut up, they perish in a few hours. The
writers just referred to, discovered that the bees,
by uniting the two wings of each side, by means
of the small marginal hooks with which they
are provided, so as to make them present the
largest possible surface to the air, were capable
of striking it with considerable force, and that
this force was increased by the wings forming a
slight concavity. The wings arranged in this
manner, are put into a violent vibratory motion
by the bees appointed to the office of ventilators,
and produce what we call a draught of air. <i>Ventilation</i>
is thus systematically accomplished. A
certain portion of ventilating bees is stationed in
files at the entrance of the hive, with their heads
turned inwards; another and a larger party, in
files also, stands a considerable way in the interior,
with their heads towards the entrance: thus both
these parties cooperate, in producing a current of
air in the same direction, and are so arranged as
not to interrupt the passage of their fellow-citizens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">- 269 -</a></span>
moving in and out. As this hard duty has
no intermission during the day, nor in hot weather
during the night, and must necessarily occasion
fatigue, one set of ventilators is considerately relieved
in about twenty-five minutes, by another set
of fresh bees. Under particular circumstances
the number of ventilating bees is considerably increased.
&ldquo;When the air,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, &ldquo;was
not renewed in the manner desirable, we have seen
all vibrating their wings at once, though this never
occurs in the natural state, when the vibrations
of a few are sufficient for ventilation.&rdquo; Although
this fanning motion of the wings is so rapid as to
render them almost indistinguishable, yet they
may be observed to describe an arc of 90&deg;. The
sagacious bees remind me of a method which is
sometimes adopted of renewing the air of a room,
called pumping; some person moves the door
backward and forward so rapidly as to cause a
thorough agitation of the confined air, and the introduction
of a fresh unvitiated atmosphere.
&ldquo;When they are engaged in ventilation, the bees
by means of their feet and claws, fix themselves
as firmly as possible, to the place they stand upon.
The first pair of legs is stretched out before;
the second extended to the right and left: whilst
the third, placed very near each other, are perpendicular
to the abdomen, so as to give that part
considerable elevation.&rdquo; That ventilation is carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">- 270 -</a></span>
on for the purpose of renewing the air of the hives,
and not for lowering its temperature, is evident
from its being continued to a certain extent, even
during the depth of winter.</p>

<p>The vibratory motion of the bee&rsquo;s wings has
been regarded by some as the principal cause of
the <i>humming</i> noise heard in every prosperous hive
during the busy season. This humming has likewise
been attributed to the rushing of the air
through their spiracles: so thought <span class="smcap">M. Chabrier</span>,
and, I believe, <span class="smcap">Mr. J. Hunter</span>. Mr. H. assures
us that bees can produce a sound independently
of their wings; for if these be smeared over with
honey so as to stick together, the bee still makes
a noise, which is shrill and peevish. He found
the same effect from holding the bee by the legs,
with a pair of pincers, while the wings were perfectly
still, and also by immersing the insect in
water, though not till it was very much teased.</p>

<p>The whole body of a drone is in a state of vibration
when it hums. Though deprived of its
wings, it is capable of producing a sound exactly
similar, and probably the same with its former
hum: even when the legs are cut off, the trunk
retains its tremulous motion, and utters an audible
noise. If immersed in water, many air-bubbles are
disengaged from it: but though the mutilated
insect be taken out alive, it is no longer sonorous.
&ldquo;This experiment, however incomplete,&rdquo; says a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">- 271 -</a></span>
writer in the <i>Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles</i>,
&ldquo;tends at least to prove, that the humming of bees
is not occasioned by a strong vibration of the internal
part of the upper wings, but rather by a
tremulous affection of the entire body; and perhaps
even by the escape of a greater quantity of
air through the stigmata or spiracles. This last
would amount to a sort of voice.&rdquo; The humming
noise with which a flower is always approached by
the bee, ceases as soon as she has alighted upon
it, though during the time that she is extracting
its sweets she is in a constant vibratory motion.</p>

<p>The term circulation is not strictly applicable
to the imperfect sanguineous system of insects, as
the fluid which supplies their bodies with nutriment
is not distributed to its several parts through
the medium of a heart and vascular system.
Lyonnet and Cuvier are both of opinion that insects
have no heart, whereas all creatures that
possess a circulation, properly so called, have a
heart, lungs or gills, and a liver; but insects have
only air-vessels and hepatic ducts. The chyle
which is produced in their intestines, transpiring
through the pores of the intestinal canal, passes
into the general cavity of the body, where it is
probably animalized, and made to answer the
same purposes that blood does to creatures of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">- 272 -</a></span>
higher class, though when animalized it still retains
its white colour. Although its distribution
is obscure, from its analogy to blood, we may conclude
that it is a fluid which visits and nourishes
every part of the insect&rsquo;s body; that from it secretions
are made, and that, as in other creatures, it
is fitted for these purposes by receiving oxygen
from the air-vessels. <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> has observed that
the blood of insects, &ldquo;for want of a circulating
system, not being able to seek the air, the air
goes to seek the blood;&rdquo; the air-vessels, as I have
stated under the head of Respiration, are distributed
to every part of the body.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Nutrition.</span></p>

<p>From what I have said under the head of Circulation,
it will appear evident that the bodies of
bees and other insects are supplied with nutriment
in a very simple manner. <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> is of
opinion that it is obtained by direct absorption or
transudation, by imbibition as he calls it, through
the pores of the intestinal canal, along which the
blood or animalized chyle passes: and <span class="smcap">Lyonnet</span>
thinks that this imbibition is analogous to that
which takes place from the earth by the roots of
plants.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Secretion.</span></p>

<p>Every thing connected with the subject of secretion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">- 273 -</a></span>
seems to be obscure: it is evident, however,
that secretions do take place; for silk, wax,
and poison are all the results of that process.
The first of these substances is only secreted by
the bee when in its larva state. I must refer
those who wish for information respecting silk, to
those naturalists who have written on the silk-worm.
The secretion of wax I shall treat of
hereafter in a distinct chapter; and it will be
better perhaps to speak of Poison, after describing
the sting and its appurtenances. There is one secretion
however, on which I will say a few words
in this place,&mdash;viz. Perspiration.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Perspiration.</span></p>

<p>The <i>temperature of insects</i> not gregarious, is
generally that of the medium they inhabit; but
bees possess the power not only of preserving a
high temperature during the coldest mouths of
winter, but of raising that temperature under particular
circumstances. <span class="smcap">Dr. Darwin</span> has observed
that they generate heat by a general motion of
their legs, as they hang clustered together in the
hives: <span class="smcap">Huber</span> thinks that it may be increased by
the agitation of their wings;&mdash;whatever disturbs
them so as to cause a tumult invariably produces
a considerable accession of heat. <span class="smcap">Inch</span>, a <i>German</i>,
plunged a thermometer into a bee-hive in the
winter, and saw the mercury stand 27 degrees higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">- 274 -</a></span>
than it did in the open air. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> found
the <i>heat of a hive</i> vary from 73&deg; to 84&deg; of Fahrenheit;
and <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, who says that in a prosperous
hive the thermometer in winter commonly stands
at from 86&deg; to 88&deg;, and in summer between 95&deg;
and 97&deg;, states that he has observed it, on some
occasions, to rise suddenly from about 92&deg; to above
104&deg;. The former naturalist, about ten o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, in the middle of July, when the
quicksilver in the thermometer in the open air
ranged at 54&deg;, found that on plunging it into a
bee-hive, it rose in less than five minutes to 82&deg;.
At five the next morning it stood at 79&deg;,&mdash;at nine
it had risen to 83&deg;,&mdash;at one to 84&deg;; and at nine in
the evening it had fallen to 78&deg;. On the 30th of
December, when the temperature of the air was
35&deg;, that in the hive was 73&deg;. Bees also possess
the power of counteracting or throwing off superabundant
heat, by perspiration. <span class="smcap">Huber</span> observed,
that when crowded together in hot weather,
they become much heated, and perspire so
copiously that those near the bottom seem perfectly
drenched, and are for a time incapable of
flying from the moisture on their wings.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Motion.</span></p>

<p>The <i>motions of insects</i> are performed through
the medium of an appropriate apparatus of muscles,
which move the head, trunk, abdomen, viscera,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">- 275 -</a></span>
and limbs, as in other parts of the animal
creation. The muscles of insects generally possess
very great power, as may be seen by the
motion of the mandibles, and the propulsion of
the bee&rsquo;s sting. It is very strikingly evinced
also in the flea. <span class="smcap">Latreille</span> gives an account of
one that dragged a silver cannon twenty-four
times its own weight, firing it off afterwards,
without exhibiting any symptom of fear. An
English workman also is said to have made an
ivory coach, with six horses, a coachman on the
seat with a dog between his legs, a postillion, four
persons in the coach, and four lacqueys behind,&mdash;the
whole of which was dragged by a single flea.
A further evidence of the muscular power of the
flea is the extent of its leaps, which equal a space
of 200 times the length of its own body. This
calculation, or a very similar one, was made by
<span class="smcap">Socrates</span>, who was much ridiculed for it by
<span class="smcap">Aristophanes</span>. The poet, however, did not confine
his ridicule to this minuteness of calculation,
but attacked likewise the character and precepts
of that great philosopher; for the whole of which
satire he has justly incurred the censure of posterity.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Organs of Reproduction.</p>

<p>These organs, in the drone, correspond in function
and denomination with those of the higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">- 276 -</a></span>
classes of animals: their chief peculiarity consists
in their size, in proportion to that of the insect,
and in their being more under the belly than in
other insects of this tribe;&mdash;they are larger than
those of the humble-bee, and the two last scales
of the back and belly are larger than those of the
queen or workers.</p>

<p>The female organs consist principally of the
ovaries, the oviducts, the sperm-reservoir, and
the ovipositor. In the ovaries the eggs are generated,
and remain till rendered fit by impregnation,
and the other circumstances necessary for
their maturation, to pass through the oviducts.
According to Mr. Hunter, what are called ovaries
are really ducts; the eggs therefore are not formed
as in other animals, in a cluster on the back,
but in those ducts, of which there are six on each
side. When full of eggs, they form a kind of
quadrangle; these six ducts uniting on each side
into one duct, this latter enters a duct common
to both sides, which may be called the <i>vagina</i> or
<i>ovipositor</i>. The common <i>oviduct</i> is the canal
through which the eggs pass from the ovaries as
they are called, to the ovipositor. The <i>sperm-reservoir</i>
is the organ which, according to Herold,
receives the <i>impregnating sperm</i> of the drone, the
<i>modus operandi</i> of which we are unacquainted
with. In the hive-bee and in some other insects,
the influence of this sperm continues so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">- 277 -</a></span>
a time, and through so many generations, as
almost to exceed belief. (<i>Vide</i> <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>). This led
<span class="smcap">Dr. Haighton</span> to entertain the opinion that
actual contact betwixt the male sperm and the
egg was not necessary, but that impregnation was
effected by some unknown sympathetic influence.
<span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span> have recourse to the
old doctrine of an <i>aura seminalis</i> being all that
is required to vivify the egg, and which they think
may be retained for a long period. Upon this
subject I have entered at some length in <a href="#Page_25">page
25</a> <i>et seq.</i> The <i>ovipositor</i> places the eggs in
their appropriate situations, and is an instrument
of most curious structure. It consists of a long
tube, or rather several tubes, retractile within
each other, like the pieces of a telescope, and
serves not only to convey the extruded eggs to the
place of their destination, but acts also as a sheath
for <i>the sting</i>, having a sharp point which makes
the first impression when the creature intends to
use its sting,&mdash;indeed it appears to be itself the
sting. It has a slit near its extremity, through
which the sting and poison are allowed to pass
at the time of stinging. Some insects have occasion
to bore a hole in wood, or other hard substances,
to obtain a proper nidus for their eggs;
the ovipositor is their operating instrument, and
will either saw or bore a passage to the desired
place. Thus it appears that this curiously complex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">- 278 -</a></span>
apparatus, which in the bee is used both as
a weapon of defence and offence, is a hollow horny
tube or scabbard, inclosing two bearded darts,
which can be thrust a short way beyond the
sheath, though the whole appears to the naked
eye like the solid point of the minutest needle.</p>

<p>This apparatus is moved by muscles which,
though invisible to the eye, are yet strong enough
to force the sting to the depth of one twelfth of
an inch through the thick cuticle of a man&rsquo;s hand.
It is articulated by thirteen scales to the lower
end of the insect&rsquo;s body; and at its root are situated
two glands or ducts, from which the poison
is secreted: these glands uniting in one duct, eject
the venomous liquid along the groove formed by
the junction of the two piercers. There are four
beards on the outside of each piercer: when the
insect is prepared to sting, one of these piercers,
having its point a little longer or more in advance
than the other, first darts into the flesh, and being
fixed by its foremost beard, the other strikes in
also, and they alternately penetrate deeper and
deeper, till they acquire a firm hold of the flesh
with their hooks, and then follows the sheath entering
and conveying the poison into the wound.
The action of the sting, says <span class="smcap">Paley</span>, affords an
example of the union of <i>chemistry</i> and <i>mechanism:</i>
of chemistry, in respect to the <i>venom</i> which can
produce such powerful effects: of mechanism, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">- 279 -</a></span>
the sting is a compound instrument. The machinery
would have been comparatively useless
had it not been for the chemical process, by which
in the insect&rsquo;s body <i>honey</i> is converted into
<i>poison</i>; and on the other hand, the poison would
have been ineffectual, without an instrument to
wound, and a syringe to inject it.</p>

<p>In consequence of the barbed form of its sting
the bee can seldom disengage itself without leaving
behind it the whole apparatus, and even part of
its bowels; so that her life is usually sacrificed to
her passion.</p>

<p><i>The sting of the queen-bee</i> is longer and stouter
than that of the working-bee, and bends a little
under her belly. She is not eager to employ it;
and from what has been said above, of the fatality
which usually attends its use, conjecture has been
busy as to the cause of her extreme caution in
this respect. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> observes, that it cannot
arise from any selfish consideration, founded on
an instinctive knowledge of the danger she thereby
incurs; since the common bees, who run the same
risk when they sting, are ready to attack upon
the slightest provocation. &ldquo;Is it owing,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;to a consciousness of the importance of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">- 280 -</a></span>
life to the community? or may we rather ascribe
it to the dignified and generous forbearance so
frequently exemplified in the lion or English
mastiff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reluctance of queens to eject their stings,
led Pliny and others to imagine that they did not
possess any. Their extreme caution in this respect,
and the fatal consequences usually attending
a departure from it, gave birth to the following
jeux d&rsquo;esprit. In consequence of Pope Urban the
Eighth being suspected of a stronger attachment
to the French than to the Spaniards, a Frenchman
who had observed <i>three bees</i> quartered upon his
arms, wrote this Latin verse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">&ldquo;Gallis mella dabunt, Hispanis spicula figent.&rdquo;</div>

<p>To this a Spaniard is said to have subjoined,</p>

<div class="blockquot">&ldquo;Spicula si figant, emorientur apes.&rdquo;</div>

<p>To close the series, and to show his universal
paternal regard towards his flock, Pope Urban
is made to add the following distich:</p>

<div class="blockquot">&ldquo;Cunctis mella dabunt, et nullis spicula figent,<br />
Spicula rex<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> etenim figere nescit apum.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> The ancients supposed the sovereign of the bees to be
a male.</p></div>

<p>This <i>caution of the queens</i> is never more conspicuously
evinced than <i>in their combats with each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">- 281 -</a></span>
other</i>, for they instantly separate if there be any
danger of <i>mutual</i> destruction from the darting
forth of their stings. <span class="smcap">Huber</span> gives a striking instance
of this. Two queens in one of his hives
having left their cells at nearly the same instant,
rushed together with great apparent fury. The
antenn&aelig; of each were seized by the teeth of the
other, and the head, breast, and belly of both
were mutually opposed. Finding themselves however
thus dangerously situated, and their curved
extremities on the point of meeting, each disengaged
itself and flew away; when the other
bees, who had before receded, to make a clear
arena for the combatants, drove them together
again. This was done repeatedly, till at last the
stronger queen, seizing the other&rsquo;s wing, and
curling her extremities under her belly, inflicted
a mortal sting.</p>

<p>I think this observation of Huber puts a negative
upon Dr. Evans&rsquo;s last question, and to assent
to his first would I apprehend raise her majesty
too high in the scale of existence. I believe
we must here, as in many other similar cases,
acknowledge our ignorance, and refer the proceeding
to instinct.</p>

<p>We have seen that where there is more than
one native queen in a hive, there is always a
combat between them, terminating in the death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">- 282 -</a></span>
of all but one. It was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Schirach</span>
and <span class="smcap">Riem</span>, that if a stranger queen were introduced
where there was a native one, the former would
be assailed by the workers, and by them stung to
death. The experiments of <span class="smcap">Huber</span> and <span class="smcap">Dunbar</span>
discountenance this opinion: indeed Huber says
that in the whole course of his experience he
never knew more than one instance of a queen&rsquo;s
being stung by a worker, and that was wholly
unintentional.</p>

<p>But though the experiments to which I have
just alluded, produced different results from what
we were led to expect by Schirach and Riem, yet
those of <span class="smcap">Huber</span> did not correspond with those of
<span class="smcap">Dunbar</span>. The former introduced two stranger
queens into hives containing native queens; of the
latter, one was fertile the other a virgin,&mdash;the former
were both fertile. Each of these introductions
led to a single combat between the queens,
and each terminated in the death of the stranger.
The latter gentleman also on two occasions introduced
stranger queens to the queens regnant,
in his mirror-hive; but in neither case were they
stung to death, either by the queen or workers,
but merely surrounded and confined by the latter,
and by that confinement either suffocated or
starved to death. <span class="smcap">Schirach</span> and <span class="smcap">Riem</span> had probably
witnessed similar conduct on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">- 283 -</a></span>
workers, and were no doubt led thereby to conjecture
that they dispatched the queens with their
stings.</p>

<p>From what has been said of the fatal consequence
to the bee itself when it makes use of its
sting for the annoyance of man and other animals,
it might be supposed that the darting of this
weapon by one bee into the body of another,
might cause the death of both; but this is not
usually the case, otherwise there would be a great
mortality amongst them, when the persecution of
the drones takes place. <span class="smcap">Huber</span> contrived, by placing
several of his hives upon a glass table, to witness
this scene of massacre; on which occasion the
bees thrust their stings so deeply into the bodies
of the drones, (generally between the segments of
the abdomen,) as to be obliged to turn upon themselves,
as upon a pivot, before they could extricate
them; but by so doing they succeeded, as do the
queens also in their combats with each other.
Instances are related, of combats between workers
proving mutually destructive, from the victors
being unable to extricate their stings from the
wounds they have inflicted. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> saw
an instance of this: the bee was stung in the
mouth; and he saw it running about afterwards,
with the sting and its appurtenances adherent in
the wound.</p>

<p>Indeed by allowing the bee to draw out her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">- 284 -</a></span>
Sting gradually, when we ourselves are stung,&mdash;which
if we had sufficient firmness and presence
of mind to remain still, she would instinctively do,
by bringing the beards close down to the sides of
the darts,&mdash;the life of this valuable insect might be
preserved, and the pain in the wounded part be
much lessened: but the alarm of both parties
seldom admits of such forbearance. The wasp is
not so liable to leave its sting behind as the bee,
the beards of the former being rather shorter, and
the insect stronger and more active.</p>

<p>The sooner the sting is extracted the less venom
is ejected, and consequently less inflammation induced.
To alleviate the irritation, numberless
<i>remedies</i> have been proposed, of the most opposite
kind and uncertain effect; as oil, vinegar, bruised
parsley, burnet, mallow, or the leaves of any succulent
vegetable (renewed as soon as warm, and
probably therefore operating by cold alone), honey,
indigo dissolved in water, &amp;c. &amp;c. The <i>most effectual</i>
remedy appears to be the <i>Aq. Ammon.</i> or
<i>Spirit of Hartshorn</i>: nor is this surprising, when
we consider that <i>the venom of the bee, or wasp, is
evidently acid</i>. <i>If a humble-bee be irritated to sting
paper tinged with litmus, or any other of the vegetable
blues, the colour is changed by the acid of the
venom to a bright red;</i> this acid appears not to
differ from the acid (<i>bombic</i>) of silk-worms, or
(<i>formic</i>) of ants. The acrimony of the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">- 285 -</a></span>
many have experienced when inadvertently sitting
down on an ant-hill. On this principle, a solution
of any alkali, or even lime-water, might answer
the same purpose; and soap would have the
double advantage of neutralizing the acid and allaying
the inflammation, by the oil which would be disengaged.
Plunging the part stung into cold or
warm water would afford the same relief as in burns,
&amp;c. and also dilute the acid acrimony. Quietness
is the surest protection against being stung.
It has lately been affirmed, that a person is perfectly
secure amidst myriads of bees, if he carefully
keep his mouth shut, and breathe gently
through the nostrils only, the human breath being,
as it would appear, highly offensive to their delicate
organs. (<i>Vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXII">Senses of Bees</a>.) It is added
that with this precaution, hives may be turned
up, and even part of the combs cut out, while the
bees are at work, with perfect impunity.</p>

<p>Those who wish to view the sting of a wasp or
bee through a microscope, may cut off the end of
its tail, when by touching it with a needle or pin
it will thrust out the darts and their sheath, which
may be then snipt off with a pair of scissors and
reserved for observation. If the insect be caught
in a leather glove and provoked to eject its sting,
the same end will be answered; as the sting being
detained by its barbs, will be left in the leather,
from whence, when the creature is dead (which in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">- 286 -</a></span>
the case of a wasp will not be for many hours),
the whole apparatus may, with care, be extracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon examining the edge of a very keen
razor by the microscope, it appeared as broad as
the back of a pretty thick knife, rough, uneven,
and full of notches and furrows, and so far from any
thing like sharpness, that an instrument as blunt
as this seemed to be, would not serve even to
cleave wood<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>.&rdquo; &ldquo;An exceedingly small needle
being also examined, the point thereof appeared
above a quarter of an inch in breadth; not round,
nor flat, but irregular and unequal; and the surface,
though extremely smooth and bright to the
naked eye, seemed full of ruggedness, holes, and
scratches. In short it resembled an iron bar out
of a smith&rsquo;s forge<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>.&rdquo; But the sting of a bee,
viewed through the same instrument, showed
every where a polish most amazingly beautiful,&mdash;without
the least flaw, blemish, or inequality; and
ended in a point too fine to be discovered: yet
this is only the case or sheath of instruments much
more exquisite, contained therein, as before described.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Poison of Bees.</span></p>

<p>The <i>poison of bees</i>, as also that of wasps, is a
transparent fluid: applied to the tongue it imparts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">- 287 -</a></span>
a sweet taste, which is succeeded by a hot
acrid one. It gives a slight red tinge, as has been
already hinted, to litmus paper, and hence the
<span class="smcap">Abbé Fontana</span> has concluded that an acid enters
into its composition, but in very small proportion.
The venom is so extremely active, that he conjectures
a grain in weight would kill a pigeon in
a few seconds. It is this fluid which causes the inflammation
consequent upon being stung. A puncture
from a needle that was charged with it, would
produce precisely the same effects. These effects
are very different in different persons; for whilst a
single sting will produce alarming symptoms in
one individual, another may receive numerous
punctures without sustaining pain or inflammation
in any considerable degree; sometimes without
suffering either. The activity of the venom
varies according to the season of the year: a sting
received in winter produces much less inconvenience
than one inflicted in summer; the pain and
inflammation are neither so intense nor of such
long continuance. This may arise from there
being a more copious secretion of venom in summer
than in winter; for during the former season, if
a bee inflict several wounds with its sting, the pain
and inflammation become progressively less at each
consecutive puncture: after three or four punctures,
it is rendered incapable of producing more
inconvenience than the point of a sharp needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">- 288 -</a></span></p>

<p>If a bee be provoked to dart its sting against
glass, so as to eject its venom upon it, and the
glass thus charged be placed upon a double microscope,
oblong pointed crystals will become visible;
these may be seen at first floating in the
venom, and gradually shooting into crystals as the
fluid part evaporates.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Anger of Bees.</span></p>

<p>I have already treated of the disposition of bees
to use their stings, when irritated, either by direct
interference with them, or by the approach of persons
to whom they have an antipathy. <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>
has, in strong terms, noticed their irascibility:&mdash;when
once provoked, says he, they set no bounds
to their anger, but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Deem life itself to vengeance well resign&rsquo;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Die on the wound, and leave their stings behind.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Fatal consequences</i> occurring from their wounds
are not often heard of, though such I believe have
occasionally happened. <span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> and
<span class="smcap">Spence</span> relate an instance of a violent fever being
produced, by the injury they inflicted, and in
which the person&rsquo;s recovery was for some time
doubtful. <span class="smcap">Mungo Park</span> also mentions, in his
Travels, an instance of severe annoyance from
them, and states that he lost several asses in
Africa owing to their being attacked by bees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">- 289 -</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Talbot</span>, in his Five Years Residence in the
Canadas, states, that during the summer of 1820,
the <i>Rev. Ralph Leeming</i> having sent a fine horse
to grass at a neighbouring farmer&rsquo;s, who kept
about twenty stocks of bees, the animal got upon
the lawn where the hives were placed, and by accident
overturned one of them, the bees of which
attacked him with great virulence. The horse,
rearing and kicking from agony, overthrew another
hive. Having thus doubled the number of his
assailants, his sufferings brought him to the ground,
and in less than five minutes from the commencement
of the attack the poor animal was literally
stung to death.</p>

<p>The anger of bees is not confined to man, and
other large animals; it is sometimes vented upon
their own kind, not only in single combat, but in
conflicts of organized masses. Cases of the former
kind every observer must have noticed; and of
the latter, several instances have been related by
<span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>, <span class="smcap">Thorley</span>, <span class="smcap">Knight</span>, and others. The
engagement, witnessed by <span class="smcap">Thorley</span>, lasted more
than two days, and originated in a swarm&rsquo;s attempting
to take possession of an already occupied
hive. Remarkable battles of this kind have also
been related by other writers. Whenever the
angry excitation is diffused through a whole community,
a great accession of heat is produced in
the hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">- 290 -</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding bees are thus occasionally
animated by a most vindictive spirit, against what
they regard as a public enemy, they are not found
to display any peculiar hostility in the revenge of
a private injury, committed upon them at a distance
from their homes. This is a fact which has
been noticed both by <span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.
Knight</span>. The former observes also, that bees
never sting but in the neighbourhood of their
property, unless hurt; that they never contend
with each other for honey, unless it be placed
within the boundary of their own right,&mdash;but that
what they have collected they defend. The indisposition
of bees to attack or be angry at a
distance has been confirmed by <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span>,
who says, that, though the most irritable of animals
near home, he has seen them suffer themselves to
be patiently robbed of their loads by other bees,
and that he has witnessed this in the same bee
three times in succession. He says likewise, that
if the wasps in a nest have their communication
cut off from those that are abroad, the latter, on
their return, will not make any attack; but that if
one escape from the interior, it evinces a very
different temper, and is ready to sacrifice its life
to avenge the injury. This <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span> discovered
when a boy, and he has no doubt but
that if a similar proceeding were adopted towards
bees, they would observe the same conduct.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">The Language of Bees.</span></p>

<p>All creatures that live in society seem to possess
the power of communicating intelligence to one
another. &ldquo;Brutes,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span>, &ldquo;have language
to express sentiments of love, of fear, and of
anger; yet they seem unable to transmit any impression
they have received from external objects.
But the language of bees is more extensive: if not
a language of ideas, it is something very similar.&rdquo;
This faculty has been very remarkably illustrated
by <span class="smcap">Huber</span> in his Treatise on Ants; and the bee
exhibits many strong evidences of it. <span class="smcap">Huber</span>
clearly shows that the communications of Ants are
made through the medium of their antenn&aelig;; he
has also proved very satisfactorily, that these
organs serve the same purpose in bees.</p>

<p>Being desirous of ascertaining whether when
a queen was removed from a hive, (a circumstance
which is communicated to the whole family within
an hour,) they discovered their loss by means of
smell, touch, or any unknown sense; he accordingly
divided a hive into two portions, by means
of a grating which admitted a free circulation of
air, but denied a passage to the bees, or even to
their antenn&aelig;: the consequence was, that the bees
contained in the half that had no queen, after they
had recovered from the agitation<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> always produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">- 292 -</a></span>
under such circumstances, set about building
royal cells, just as they would have done if the
queen had been entirely removed from the hive.
He repeated this experiment, with a grating which
allowed the transmission of the antenn&aelig; only.
Here the effect was quite different: for the bees
being able to assure themselves, by the frequent
crossing of their antenn&aelig; with those of the queen,
that she was still amongst them, every thing remained
in order; the brood were attended to, no
interruption took place in any of their labours,
nor were any royal cells commenced. From all
these experiments (and they were repeatedly
tried), it seems evident that the antenn&aelig; of bees,
as well as of ants, possess the faculty of receiving
and conveying information. Bees receive some
kinds of intelligence through the medium of certain
sounds, as has been stated in another place.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[P]</span></a> This agitation usually continues two or three hours,
sometimes (though but seldom) four or five,&mdash;never longer.</p></div>

<p><i>The antenn&aelig;</i>, in addition to the uses already
ascribed to them, may serve to <i>inform the bees of
the state of the atmosphere, and enable them to
discern the approach of a change in the weather</i>.
The suddenness and rapidity of their flight towards
the apiary, often afford a hint to the observer of
their proceedings, that a storm is at hand, of which
he received no intimation from any other quarter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>&ldquo;That the bees,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>, &ldquo;can foresee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">- 293 -</a></span>
bad weather, is a fact beyond denial; though we
know not through the medium of what sense that
faculty is exerted. We are often surprised to
find, even with a promising appearance of the sky,
their labours suddenly cease, and that not a bee
stirs out; or, on the contrary, that those which
a e abroad, hurry home in such crowds that the
door is too small for their admission. But on
strictly examining the heavens, we may discern
some small and distant clouds, which, insensibly
collecting, soon after descend in rain." The Doctor
likewise says, that an observant friend of his,
foretells with confidence that rain will fall in the
course of a few hours, when he finds on a clear
summer&rsquo;s morning that his garden is wholly
deserted by his neighbour&rsquo;s bees. In this he
enjoys an advantage over their real owner, the
flowers near the apiary being crowded as usual by
these wary foragers. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Mr. Kirby</span>,
&ldquo;they wander far from home, and do not return
till late in the evening, it is a prognostic to be
depended upon, that the following day will be
fine: but if they remain near their habitations, and
be seen frequently going and returning,&mdash;although
no indication of wet should be discoverable, clouds
will soon arise and rain come on. Ants also are
observed to be excellently gifted in this respect:
though they daily bring out their larv&aelig; to the
sun, they are never overtaken by sudden showers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">- 294 -</a></span></p>

<p>I have before stated that in the course of an
hour the important intelligence of the loss or
safety of a queen is known to a whole colony. It
seems highly improbable that in this time, 20,000
bees should have assured themselves of the presence
and safety of their queen, by applying their
antenn&aelig; to hers; such an attempt would create a
state of complete confusion. Huber proved by
a very decisive experiment, similar to those already
related, that the queen is not distinguishable by
her subjects, in consequence of any emanation
from her person. There must then be some mode,
to which I have given the name of language, by
which those who have exchanged contact with
their antenn&aelig; can communicate the tranquillizing
intelligence to their companions. It seems impossible
to explain, in any other way, the concurrence
of so many wills to one end; or that sudden
interruption and restitution of harmony which are
often exhibited in every community of bees. It
is the opinion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span> that bees are not
only capable of communicating intelligence to the
members of their own family, but that a friendly
intercourse sometimes takes place between neighbouring
colonies: the cases which he has related
in support of this opinion, however, can hardly be
said to bear him out in it; for in each of them,
after the intercourse had continued for a few days,
it terminated in violent hostility. Such instances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">- 295 -</a></span>
though not of frequent occurrence, have been
occasionally noticed by others.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Sleep of Bees.</span></p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that every part of
animated nature needs occasional intervals of repose.
That this is the case with the bee seems
evident, from the almost motionless quietude of
the workers, which often occurs for fifteen or
twenty minutes together, each bee inserting its
head and thorax into a cell, where it might be
mistaken for dead, were it not for the dilatation
of the segments of its abdomen. The queen sometimes
does the same in a drone&rsquo;s cell, where she
continues without motion a very long time, when
&ldquo;the workers form a circle round her, and gently
brush the uncovered parts of her abdomen. The
drones while reposing do not enter the cells, but
cluster in the combs, and sometimes remain without
stirring a limb for eighteen or twenty hours.&rdquo;
<span class="smcap">Huber</span> says that he has seen the workers, even in
the middle of the day, when apparently wearied
with exertion, insert half their bodies into the
empty cells, and remain there, as if taking a nap,
for half an hour or longer; at night they regularly
muster, in a sleep-like silence.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Longevity"></a><span class="smcap">Longevity of Bees.</span></p>

<p>The several members of a hive have very different
periods of existence. The general law
among insects is, that both male and female shall
perish soon after sexual union; in a few days or
weeks at furthest, according to the time, probably,
that the female occupies in maturing and depositing
her eggs. By retarding sexual union, the
lives of some insects may be very much prolonged,&mdash;even
ephemer&aelig; have been kept alive by this
means for seven or eight days. Annual plants,
if prevented from seeding, may be rendered biennial.
The bee and some other insects are exempted
from this forfeiture of life after sexual
union, with the exception already alluded to in
<a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>. The ancients were very deficient in
knowledge upon this subject. <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> fixes the
term of a bee&rsquo;s existence at seven years<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>, having
probably copied from <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>; though Aristotle
says that bees who live to an extreme old age
may reach to nine or ten years. <span class="smcap">Columella
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">- 297 -</a></span></span><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>
and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> have been supposed to regard their
existence as extending to ten years; though the
language of the former applies to the existence of
the community, and not to individual bees: and
provided the hive be never changed, nor the
combs renewed, it is not likely that any one family
should have its existence prolonged beyond that
period; as the accumulation of silken pellicles
with which the breeding-cells are successively
lined, would render them unfit for use in a very
few years. In addition to the diminution of the
cells by this succession of silken linings, they are
also diminished further by the excrement of the
larv&aelig;, which is never cleaned out, but confined
behind each lining: both together, therefore, soon
render the cells unfit for use as brood-cells.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> found three of these layers deposited
in a single season, and counted upwards of twenty
in the cells of an old comb; which, upon an average
of three a year, would correspond with the period
fixed by the ancients; though this observation by
no means proves that the hive upon which it was
made, or any other, might not have had a much
more protracted existence. <span class="smcap">Mr. Espinasse</span> tells
us that he once took a hive which had stood
fourteen years, having found that it had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">- 298 -</a></span>
weak: it had nevertheless sent off a swarm the
year previous. There is an instance or two on
record, of one family having continued in the
same hive for thirty years. One of these is
mentioned by <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>, another by <span class="smcap">Mouffet</span>.
<span class="smcap">Thorley</span> speaks of a colony having occupied
the same domicile for 110 <i>years</i>. The spot chosen
was under the leads of the study of <span class="smcap">Ludovicus
Vives</span> in Oxford: the original swarm settled there
in 1520 and kept possession till 1630. Query,&mdash;may
not the bees when the combs become very old
and the cells much diminished in size, remove them
and construct fresh ones? To those who may
wish for their own satisfaction to examine the
linings of a brood cell, I would observe, that <span class="smcap">Mr.
Hunter&rsquo;s</span> mode of proceeding was, to soak the
cell in water, till the linings were swelled, when
he had no difficulty in separating and counting
them: he found them separate most readily at the
bottom, on account of the inclosed excrement.</p>

<p>To common observers it might appear, that
the lives of the bees were coeval with the foundation
of the colony, presuming upon all the young
bees leaving the parent stock in swarms. But I
have already stated that all swarms consist of a
mixture of young and old bees; the difference
between them is very distinguishable, those of the
present year being brown, plump, and clothed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">- 299 -</a></span>
with light hairs, whilst the old ones have red hairs,
notched and ragged wings, and are paler and more
shrunk in their bodies.</p>

<p>The cases which I have related, and others of a
similar kind, have led to the erroneous opinion
that bees are a long-lived race. But this, as <span class="smcap">Dr.
Evans</span> has observed, is just as wise as if a stranger,
contemplating a populous city, and personally
unacquainted with its inhabitants, should on paying
it a second visit, many years afterwards, and
finding it equally populous, imagine that it was
peopled by the same individuals, not one of whom
might be then alive. &ldquo;Such strangers are we to
the honied hive, where, however quickly its generations
may have passed away, the same face is
presented to the beholder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual term of the male&rsquo;s existence is two
or three months only;&mdash;I say the usual term, for
his life is always cut off by violence, when no
peculiar circumstances arise to render his existence
any longer useful. Such circumstances having
arisen, as has been before observed, (<a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>,) he
may be kept alive a much longer period, for a
year at least, but how much longer has not as yet
been ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">- 300 -</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to the queen, by comparing what
has been said above, as to insects not dying till
their eggs are all matured, with what has been
stated in <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a> of a single sexual union serving
to impregnate all the eggs laid for the two
succeeding years, it would appear that the period
of her existence could not, in general, be less than
two years; and <span class="smcap">Huber</span> has proved very satisfactorily,
that this is the fact: indeed he states that
he has known a queen live for five years. <span class="smcap">Feburier</span>
suspects that, like the males, the queens
are destroyed by the labourers, when they have
fulfilled their destination. The only ground of this
opinion, however, appears to be his having witnessed
an attack made upon a queen by six
labourers, from whom he with difficulty rescued
her. <span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>, in like manner,
seem to think it not improbable that when the
workers become too old to be useful to the community,
they are either killed or expelled the
society. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>. Reaumur also throws out
a hint to the same purpose.</p>

<p>The length of a working bee&rsquo;s life has not yet
been ascertained; but the general opinion is that
it is short-lived. <span class="smcap">Butler</span> says that &ldquo;the bee is
but little more than a year&rsquo;s bird;&rdquo; and some think
the period of its existence shorter still. &ldquo;The
bees of the present year,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, &ldquo;will
retain their vigour and youthful appearance till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">- 301 -</a></span>
(Gemini), about the 21st of May in the following
year, when they begin to decline, and from
(Cancer to Leo) June 21st to August 21st, the
ground in front of the apiary may be seen strewed
with them, some dead, some dying, and a few
alive but incapable of rising again, and by (Libra)
32d September, scarcely an old bee will be left.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption2">SENSES OF BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">I</span>n</span> considering the ph&aelig;nomena of insect sensation,
little advantage can be derived from analogy; the
physiology of the senses of bees, and other insects,
is therefore but imperfectly understood. Still
they must have credit for the <i>possession</i> of senses,
however differently modified from those of man.
Some of their senses may open avenues to knowledge,
with which he must ever remain unacquainted.
Arts which he is obliged to attain
by long labour and great diligence, they seem to
derive from nature, through the medium no doubt
of organs so exquisitely fine, as to elude not only
his search, but even his conception.</p>

<p>Of all the senses of bees, none appears to be so
acute, as that of <span class="smcap">Smell</span>. It is this which, in all
probability, enables them to distinguish, not only individuals
of their own species, but one human being
from another; and also to discover honey-dews
and honey-bearing flowers, at a very considerable
distance; (honey of all odorous substances, being
the most attractive to them:) it may tend likewise
to cause that neatness which they observe in
themselves and in their habitations. An experiment,
made by <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, demonstrates that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">- 303 -</a></span>
possess the faculty of smell. He placed vessels
of honey in boxes perforated with very small
holes, to allow the odorous effluvia to escape, but
not of sufficient size to permit a sight of the honey,
when the bees came directly to the boxes. He
also tried this experiment with the addition of
small card valves, which the bees, after examining
the boxes all round, contrived to raise up, that
they might get at the honey. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> states,
that he has seen great commotion produced in
a recent swarm in wet weather, when he supposes
the bees to have been hungry, by placing
honey on the floor of the hive. It was a glass-hive,
which afforded him a good opportunity of
observing their proceedings, and he says that all
of them appeared to be upon the scent: even those
that were weak and hardly able to crawl, threw
out the proboscis as far as possible, to get at the
honey, which he thinks must have arisen from their
smelling and not from their seeing it.</p>

<p>This presumed nicety of their smell should induce
a carefulness that no offensive odours be
near an apiary. The notorious frequenting, by
bees, of the depositories of urine and the dung of
animals, might seem to render such carefulness
futile: but upon this subject I have written in a
former chapter, and have since had the pleasure
of seeing my opinion confirmed by that of <span class="smcap">Messrs.
Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>.&mdash;Bees appear to have an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">- 304 -</a></span>
antipathy to particular individuals. Their aversion,
in all probability, arises from the persons
disliked having some peculiar odour about them,
which though not unpleasant to man, may be so
to bees. Whatever the odour, it seems to be
transmitted by the breath: <span class="smcap">Huber</span> was of this
opinion. Speaking of the impunity with which his
assistant <i>Francis Burnens</i> performed his various
operations upon bees, he observes that &ldquo;the gentleness
of his motions, and the habit of repressing
his respiration, could alone preserve him from the
wrath of such formidable insects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The different reception which persons experience
on approaching the domicile of bees is attributed
by some apiarians to the different degrees
of confidence manifested in the approach: they are
of opinion, that if visitors could avoid the exhibition
of all apprehension, they would not be
attacked. My own experience has long convinced
me of the erroneousness of this opinion: and a
circumstance which occurred to <span class="smcap">Monsieur de
Hofer</span>, <i>Conseilleur d&rsquo;etat du</i> <span class="smcap">Grand Duc de
Baden</span>, strengthens my dissent from it. He had
for years been a proprietor and an admirer of bees,
and almost rivalled Wildman in the power he
possessed of approaching them with impunity: he
would at any time search for the queen, and taking
hold of her gently, place her upon his hand. But
having been unfortunately attacked with a violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">- 305 -</a></span>
fever, and long confined by it; on his recovery he
attempted to resume his favourite amusement
among the bees, returning to them with all that
confidence and pleasure which he had felt on
former occasions; when to his great surprise and
disappointment he discovered that he was no
longer in possession of their favour; and that instead
of being received by them as an old friend,
he was treated as a trespasser: nor was he ever
able, after this period, to perform any operation
upon them, or to approach within their precincts,
without exciting their anger. Here then it is
pretty evident that some change had taken place
in the Counsellor&rsquo;s secretions, in consequence of the
fever, which though not noticeable by his friends,
was offensive to the olfactory nerves of the bees.
I had this anecdote from Monsieur de Hofer&rsquo;s son,
with whom I passed a very agreeable evening in
London at the house of my friend Joseph Hodgetts,
Esq.</p>

<p>The extreme sensitiveness of smell in bees is
evinced by their promptitude in resenting an
injury inflicted on any of their community. In
hiving, or performing any other operation upon
them, great caution should therefore be observed,
lest any of them be trodden upon or crushed to
death. It may be thought that this promptitude
to resent the injury I have here mentioned, may
not proceed from the acuteness of their smell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">- 306 -</a></span>
but from an effect produced upon some other
organ of sense. I infer that it proceeds from the
former, on account of their being so quickly
roused to anger from a state of tranquillity, by
having a fresh envenomed sting and its appendages
presented before the entrance of their dwelling.
This experiment, of presenting fresh poison to the
bees, was tried by <span class="smcap">Huber</span> in such a variety of
ways, as to prove beyond all doubt that it was
the penetrating odour of the poison only, and not
the manner of presenting it, that affected them;
for when the poison had coagulated, the same
mode of presentation produced no sensible effect,
it might be offered them with perfect impunity.</p>

<p>Butterflies and Moths are supposed to be
directed by this sense to the discovery of their
mates. If the female of the eggar moth (<i>Phal&aelig;na
quercus</i>) be inclosed in a box, and placed in the
neighbourhood of the males, they are attracted to
the spot in such numbers as to show clearly that
they are sensible of her presence. We have
analogous instances of the existence of this faculty
in other insects. The flesh-fly (<i>Musca vomitoria</i>)
occasionally deposits its eggs on plants of the
Stapelia genus, no doubt from their odour resembling
that of putrefying flesh. This may be
regarded by some as an evidence of mistaken instinct;
but from what I have said in the chapter
on Instinct, I think that my readers will consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">- 307 -</a></span>
this to be erroneous, and that it should rather be
regarded as affording presumptive evidence of
mistaken judgement. Instinct would direct the
creature to deposit its eggs where the larv&aelig; when
hatched would be furnished with the means of
subsistence, instead of thus exposing them to
perish. At all events it affords tolerably good
evidence of the existence of an organ of smell in
the insect.</p>

<p>The sense of <span class="smcap">Touch</span> in bees, that is their <i>active</i>
or <i>exploring touch</i>, seems to be very acute. To the
nicety of this sense has been attributed their power
of commencing and carrying on their works amid
the darkness of the hives. The recognition of their
queen evinces the existence of some such sense;
for the experiments related at <a href="#Page_292">page 292</a>, indicate
that her presence is not ascertained either by the
organs of sight, hearing, or smell.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Antenn&aelig;</span> have generally been considered
as their organs of touch; and indeed, in popular
language, they are usually called Feelers or horns;
they have likewise assigned to them the office of
wiping and cleaning the eyes. The antenn&aelig;, however,
are not regarded as feelers by our leading
entomologists: at present their uses are not clearly
defined. Some have regarded them as organs of
smell; others as organs of hearing; a third party
have conceived that they perform some function
of which man has no definite idea,&mdash;supplying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">- 308 -</a></span>
insect with a sixth sense, an intermediate faculty,
according to <span class="smcap">Messrs. Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>, between
hearing and touch, rendering it sensible of the
slightest movement of the circumambient air.
<span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> designates the antenn&aelig; as their sight-supplying
sense;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The same keen horns, within the dark abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Trace, for the sightless throng, a ready road,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While all the mazy threads of touch convey,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shot inward to the mind, a semblant day.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The antenn&aelig;, of which there are only a single
pair, proceed from the anterior part of the head
before the eyes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Palpi</span> are generally considered as the true
feelers; which, as well from their texture as from
the manner in which insects apply them to their
food before they begin to eat it, seems probable:
Cuvier and Lehmann were of this opinion. The
palpi are attached to the under jaws and lips, and
are four in number. In some respects they
bear analogy to the antenn&aelig;; but the latter,
being more articulated, have an extended power
of motion. Some insects with small antenn&aelig;
are observed to have very large palpi, which
gives reason to suppose, that although their offices
may be different, they are intended to assist
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">- 309 -</a></span></p>

<p>The antenn&aelig; appear to be the more important
organs of the two; as the palpi, when removed,
have not been found to occasion much apparent
inconvenience; whilst from the experiments of
<span class="smcap">Huber</span> and others, it appears that the excision of
the antenna deprives the insect of the perfect
exercise of its functions. It seems immediately
to lose its instincts. The amputation of one
antenna produces no effect; but if both be cut off
near the root, the bee no longer possesses the power
of guiding itself; it cannot direct its tongue to
receive food from its companions, nor take any
share in the operations of the family; but exhibits
perfect indifference, and keeps near the entrance,
apparently for the sake of light; when that is
withdrawn, it soon leaves the hive to return no
more. &ldquo;Their departure,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, &ldquo;must
be ascribed to the loss of that sense, which is employed
to guide them in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That bees possess a fine sense of <span class="smcap">Taste</span>, may
be readily conceived from the delicious food which
they collect, and from their having a preference
for those flowers that afford the best honey, whenever
such flowers grow abundantly in the neighbourhood
of the hives. Hence the superiority of
the honey of Narbonne, Hymettus, and Pontus.
<span class="smcap">Huber</span> regards Taste as the least perfect of the
senses of bees, but the reasons he gives for this
opinion are unsatisfactory. Indeed the tongue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">- 310 -</a></span>
the bee is an organ so considerably developed, as
to afford very strong evidence of its power of
discrimination in the selection of food. <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>
considers it to be one of the primary functions of
its organization.</p>

<p>There is tolerably good presumptive evidence
that bees have a quick sense of <span class="smcap">Hearing</span>, from
their being so sensibly affected by different sounds.
The voice of the queen, for instance, has according
to <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> and <span class="smcap">Huber</span> an almost magical effect
upon them; and the practice of making some
sort of noise at the time of hiving is founded upon
this opinion. <span class="smcap">Huber</span> is of opinion that if bees do
possess the sense of hearing it is differently modified
from the same sense among beings of a higher
order. The consequences which ensue upon the
production of certain sounds either by themselves
or others, show that the vibrations of the air
make an impression upon some sense: <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, for
reasons which he does not well define, designates
it as a sense analogous to hearing, a something
acting in concert with and in aid of the antenn&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> and <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> thought that insects do
not possess the sense of hearing; but I think they
were mistaken. I have just stated the effect
produced by the voice of a queen-bee, under particular
circumstances; and there are other evidences,
equally strong, to show that insects possess
this faculty. One grasshopper will chirp in response
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">- 311 -</a></span>
to another, and the female be attracted by
the voice of the male. <span class="smcap">Brunelli</span> shut up a male
in a box, and allowed the female her liberty: as
soon as the male chirped she flew to him immediately.
For further evidence of the existence of
this faculty in insects, see <a href="#Page_262">page 262</a>. (Organs of
Sensation.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eye-Sight</span> of bees, notwithstanding the
wonderful mechanism of their eyes, seems less
perfect than their other senses: on some occasions
it scarcely serves them to distinguish the entrance
of their hives, when they come home loaded with
provision. <span class="smcap">Wildman</span> says that he has observed
them go up and down, seeking the door of the
hive, and be obliged after alighting to rise again
in order to find it: he conceived that they see
better when flying than when on foot. I believe,
however, that this opinion of <span class="smcap">Wildman</span> will not,
upon examination, be found quite correct. The
mere act of flying does not enable them to see
objects better; but when on the wing, they are at
a greater distance from those objects, the eyes of
these insects being so constructed as to enable
them to see best at a moderate distance. As <span class="smcap">Dr.
Evans</span> has justly remarked, therefore, &ldquo;the poet&rsquo;s
disdainful allusion to a</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Fly whose feeble ray scarce spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An inch around&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p0">should here be exactly reversed.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Dr. Derham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">- 312 -</a></span></span> in
his Physico-theology has observed, when speaking
of the eye of the bee and other insects, that &ldquo;the
cornea and optic nerves, being always at one and
the same distance, are fitted only to see distantial
objects, but not such as are very nigh.&rdquo; This
visual orb, this seemingly simple speck, though
really complicated piece of mechanism, says <span class="smcap">Derham</span>,
"will be found upon examination to form a
curious lattice-work of several thousand hexagonal
lenses, each having a separate optic nerve ministering
to it, and therefore to be considered as a
distinct eye<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>. <span class="smcap">M. Leewenhoeck</span>, having properly
prepared and placed an eye of this kind betwixt
his microscope and a church steeple (299 feet
high and 750 distant), saw plainly the steeple inverted,
through every different lens, though each
lens was not larger than a needle&rsquo;s point. Yet,
doubtless the insect perceives but a single object,
and that in an upright position. The hemispheric
arrangement of these lenses enables the bee to see
accurately in every direction, and without any
interval of time or trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> The multitude of hexagonal lenses which compose the
eye of a bee, make it appear, when viewed through a microscope,
exactly like honey-comb.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The eyes of all insects are immoveable, and
have neither iris nor pupil nor eyelids to cover
them: but this apparent defect is amply made up
to them in a variety of ways: in the case before
us, by the complex structure of the organs.
<span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> performed an experiment similar to that
which I have just related of <span class="smcap">Leewenhoeck</span>, and
with a like result, <span class="smcap">Hooke</span> computed the lenses
in the eye of a horse-fly to amount to nearly 7000.
<span class="smcap">Leewenhoeck</span> found more than 12,000 in that
of a dragon-fly; and 17,325 have been counted in
the eye of a butterfly. The lenses are most
numerous in the beetle, and so small as not to be
easily discoverable under a pocket microscope,
except the eye be turned white by long keeping.</p>

<p>The peculiar construction of the bee&rsquo;s eye, for
seeing objects best at a moderate distance, will
account for the circumstance noticed by <span class="smcap">Wildman</span>,
and also for the following observation of <span class="smcap">Dr.
Evans</span>. &ldquo;We frequently observe bees flying
straight homewards through the trackless air, as
if in full view of the hive, then running their heads
against it, and seeming to <i>feel</i> their way to the
door with their antenn&aelig;, as if totally blind.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Sir
C. S. Mackenzie</span> remarked the imperfect vision
of bees, and how very much puzzled they are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">- 314 -</a></span>
find the entrances to their hives, if the relative
position of the entrances be altered, or the hives
be removed two or three yards from the place
where they have usually stood. In cases of removal,
the bees do not during the first day fly to
a distance, nor till they have visited and recognized
neighbouring objects. <span class="smcap">Mr. Rogers</span>, in his &ldquo;Pleasures
of Memory,&rdquo; has noticed this defective
vision in the bee. Having spoken of her excursive
flights to a distance, and referred to her bending
her course homewards again, he observes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&ldquo;That eye so finely wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beyond the search of sense, the soar of thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now vainly asks the scenes she left behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its orb so full, its vision so confined!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he concludes that it is by the aid of memory
that she retraces her passage back to the hive, by
recognizing the scents of the various flowers
which she has passed or visited on her outward
journey,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The varied scents that charm&rsquo;d her as she flew.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this idea, as Messrs. Kirby and Spence have
observed, is more poetical than accurate, the bees
being always accustomed to fly to their hives in
right lines.</p>

<p>In consequence of this peculiarity of insect
vision, many of those bees that return homewards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">- 315 -</a></span>
after dusk in the evening, are obliged to lie abroad
all night. The same peculiarity, added to the
acuteness of their smell, has given birth to various
contrivances for inducing bees of different hives
to mingle peaceably together, as mentioned at
<a href="#Page_154">page 154</a>.</p>

<p>From the experiments of Swammerdam, Reaumur,
Hooke and others, it seems that bees and other
insects, particularly those of the hymenopterous
order, possess organs of vision, besides those which
are properly called their eyes. These organs,
known by the name of <span class="smcap">Stemmata</span>, are three smooth,
glossy, hemispherical dots, placed in a triangular
position upon the vertex or top of the head. The
two reticular eyes of one of these insects having
been covered with fluid pitch, (the stemmata being
left open,) when placed under a glass, the insect
ran up and down, but without striking against the
sides of the glass. In a similar experiment upon
a dragon-fly (<i>Libellula</i>), the insect flew away,
but in its flight struck against walls and other
objects. The stemmata in another insect being
covered, and the reticular eyes left open, seemed
to cause no impediment to its usual proceedings,
it appeared to see as well as before. But when
both the stemmata and the eyes were covered,
the insect seemed to be totally deprived of sight,
it walked slowly under the glass, and when allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">- 316 -</a></span>
its liberty, would not venture to fly. These experiments
being tried upon bees by Reaumur,
they remained immoveable, appearing uncertain
where to direct their flight: when their eyes only
were covered, they flew perpendicularly upwards
till they were out of sight, seeming to follow that
direction which the aid of the stemmata afforded
them. These stemmata may, from their situation,
assist the insect in performing its various operations
in the interior of the hive; may, as Reaumur
has observed, answer to them the purpose of
microscopes.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this chapter on the Senses
of Bees without noticing the theory of that eminent
physiologist <span class="smcap">Dr. Virey</span>. He has given it as his
opinion, that there are seven senses, which he thus
divides. Four physical, namely, Touch, Taste,
Smell, and Love; three intellectual, namely.
Hearing, Sight, and Thought. (<i>N. Dict. d&rsquo;Hist.
Nat.</i>) Whether Love and Thought should be
added to my enumeration of the senses of bees
I shall not now inquire: if they may be, this work
will supply abundant evidence of both, if we comprehend
the whole community of bees; for though
physical love appears not to constitute any part
of the pleasure of the working bee, (except from
some accidental cause which has been already
explained,) there is presumptive proof of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">- 317 -</a></span>
possessing thought or intellect: and although it
may not be easy to adduce testimony in favour
of the queen&rsquo;s or the drone&rsquo;s possessing thought,
they both satisfactorily evince a susceptibility of
physical love.</p>

<p class="caption2">INSTINCTS OF BEES.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">A</span>ll</span> creatures, of whatever size, that live together
in large communities, have long been observed to
display more knowledge and ingenuity than those
that do not congregate: this superiority is also
supposed to distinguish those which possess the
most exquisite sense of touch, and whose occupations
require a continued exertion of their powers.
The insect tribe strongly confirm the truth of
these remarks.</p>

<p>Solitary insects may exhibit a single trait of
superiority, either in the catching of their prey,
as the spider does; or in the securing of a well
protected habitation, as is instanced by the carpenter
bee, the mason bee, and some other lone
and non-associating insects: but the history of
those which unite in societies unfolds more of
insect energy and talent. In large communities a
combination of exertions is requisite, to procure
supplies for the general weal; an intercourse of
mutual intelligence is kept up; labour is regularly
divided; the sphere of action is extended; and in
cases of emergency, there is an unusual manifestation
of insect power and intelligence. Instances of
all these faculties are eminently conspicuous in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">- 319 -</a></span>
the honey-bee;&mdash;some of them I have before noticed,
and shall now advert to a few more.</p>

<p>The mental powers of bees, if I may be allowed
to use the term, have been included, by some
writers under the general name of Instinct<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a>;
others, considering the whole of their proceedings
to be fraught with intelligence, have regarded
them as evidences of a reasoning power. <i>All</i> the
ph&aelig;nomena of insect life cannot I presume be explained
without giving them credit for both.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> Huber has observed that the instinct of the humble-bee
is still more <i>refined</i> than that of the honey-bee. As an
instance of this, he states that the former when unable to
penetrate a flower through its natural cavity, makes an aperture
at the base of the corolla, or even of the calyx, and insinuates
its proboscis into the reservoir of honey, through
the opening it has made.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>A snail having crept into one of <i>M. Reaumur&rsquo;s</i>
hives early in the morning, after crawling about for
some time, adhered by means of its own slime to
one of the glass panes, where, but for the bees,
it would probably have remained, till either a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">- 320 -</a></span>
moist air or its own spume had loosened the adhesion.
The bees having discovered the snail,
immediately surrounded it, and formed a border
of propolis round the verge of its shell, which
was, at last, so securely fixed to the glass, as to
become immoveable, either by the moisture of the
air from without, or by the snail&rsquo;s secretion from
within.</p>

instances are related of the protraction of life in snails. After
they had lain in a cabinet above fifteen years, immersing

<p><i>Maraldi</i> has related a somewhat similar instance.
A houseless snail or slug, as it is called,
had entered one of his hives: the bees, as soon as
they observed it, pierced it with their stings, till
it expired beneath their repeated strokes; after
which, being unable to dislodge it, they covered
it all over with propolis.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>In these two cases, who can withhold his admiration
of the ingenuity and judgement of the bees?
<i>In the first case</i>, a troublesome creature gained
admission into the hive, which, from its unwieldiness,
they could not remove, and which, from the
impenetrability of its shell, they could not destroy:
here then their only resource was to deprive
it of loco-motion, and to obviate putrefaction;
both which objects they accomplished most skilfully
and securely,&mdash;and, as is usual with these
sagacious creatures, at the least possible expense
of labour and materials. They applied their
cement, where alone it was required, namely,
round the verge of the shell. <i>In the latter case</i>,
to obviate the evil of putrescence, by the total
exclusion of air, they were obliged to be more
lavish in the use of their embalming material, and
to form with it so complete an incrustation or
case over the &ldquo;slime-girt giant,&rdquo; as to guard them
from the consequences which the atmosphere invariably
produces upon all animal substances,
that are exposed to its action after life has become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">- 322 -</a></span>
extinct. May it not be asked, What means
more effectual could human wisdom have devised,
under similar circumstances? Indeed, many of
the proceedings of bees and other associated insects
seem traceable to a reasoning power; for
they exhibit an adaptation of means to ends,
and vary them to suit particular emergencies,&mdash;the
judicious performance of actions with a view to
some proposed end, is the criterion by which we
judge of rationality.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the difficulty of ascribing
some of their actions to any other principle than
that which is known by the name of <i>Instinct</i>, has
led to a classification of the whole of their proceedings
under <i>that</i> head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Instinct</span> is a faculty the exercise of which implies
an exquisitely fine mechanism of some of the
senses. It appears to operate independently of
all anticipation of consequences; the avenues to
knowledge are, to be sure, less circuitous in these
and other animals than in man, neither experience
nor inductive reasoning seem to be at all essential
to the perfection of their operations; they may be
said to have, what many an indolent human being
has wished to find,&mdash;a royal road to knowledge.</p>

<p>One writer, and that a very ingenious one, has
endeavoured to resolve <i>all</i> instincts into reason,
and has boldly hazarded the following conjecture.
"If we were better acquainted with the histories
of those insects that are formed into societies,&mdash;as
the bees, wasps and ants,&mdash;we should find that
their arts and improvements are not so similar and
uniform as they now appear to us, but that they
arose in the same manner (from experience and tradition)
as the arts of our own species; though their
reasoning is from few ideas, is busied about fewer
objects, and is exerted with less energy<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> Darwin.</p></div>

<p>Since the Doctor wrote this passage, much light
has been thrown upon those very subjects on
which he laments our defective knowledge: but
whilst it strengthens what I have said as to the
possession of reason by insects, it confirms my
observations respecting their instinctive powers.</p>

<p>There are facts recorded, in <span class="smcap">Huber&rsquo;s</span> <i>researches
respecting ants</i>, which exhibit in some at least
of those insects, (<i>the Amazons</i>,) a power of acquiring
habits and characters which cannot well
be regarded as merely instinctive. The Amazons
take advantage of an improvement in their condition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">- 324 -</a></span>
and avail themselves of that strength,
which sometimes accrues to them, in consequence
of a large accession to their numbers. To relieve
themselves from labour, they enslave, by a <i>coup
de main</i>, a feeble colony of ants of another species,
and transporting it to their own domicile, impose
upon the captives the task of collecting provision,
rearing the young, repairing the formicary,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The Amazons become a complete aristocracy,
and like ladies and gentlemen, have servants
to wait upon them.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to determine the point where
intellect begins to dawn, nor to assign the boundary
where instinct assumes the characteristics of
reason. For it is no where more difficult to discriminate
between the regular operation of implanted
motives, and the result of acquired knowledge
and habits, than in studying the ph&aelig;nomena
presented by the bee. For the present therefore
I must be allowed to regard the provinces of reason
and instinct as undefinable; indeed it seems
highly probable that our limited faculties may never
enable us to acquire a knowledge of them. Still
the facts which I have related, and those which I
shall proceed to detail, afford such apparently strong
evidences of a reasoning faculty, that without introducing
that faculty as their source, I shall be
at a loss to explain the ph&aelig;nomena. <span class="smcap">Dr. Darwin</span>
in his <i>Zoonomia</i>, relates an anecdote of apparent ratiocination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">- 325 -</a></span>
in a <i>wasp</i>, which had caught a fly nearly
as large as itself. Kneeling down, the Doctor
saw the wasp dissever the head and tail from the
trunk of the fly, and attempt to soar with the
latter: but finding when about two feet from the
ground that the wings of the fly carried too much
sail, and caused its prize and itself to be whirled
about, by a little breeze that had arisen, it dropped
upon the ground with its prey, and deliberately
sawed off with its mandibles, first one wing
and then the other: having thus removed these
impediments to its progress, the wasp flew away
with its booty, and experienced no further molestation
from the wind.</p>

<p>Some of the proceedings of bees in glass hives
cannot be referred to their instinctive faculties,&mdash;glass
being a substance which would never be
presented to them in their natural state. &ldquo;Having
frequently observed,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>, &ldquo;on the
inside of my glass hives, prior to the formation of
cells, a number of gluey spots ranged at regular
distances, I supposed them at first to be intended
as a kind of land-marks, pointing out the divisions
of the future streets, &amp;c. On re-examination,
however, I found them evidently used as so many
footstools on the slippery glass, each bee resting
on one of these with its middle pair of legs, while
the fore-claws were hooked with the hind ones of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">- 326 -</a></span>
the next above; thus forming a <i>living</i> ladder, by
which the workers were enabled to reach the top,
and pursue their favourite plan of commencing
their combs there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very striking illustration of the reasoning
power of bees occurred to my friend <span class="smcap">Mr. Walond</span>.
Inspecting his bee-boxes at the end of October
1817, he perceived that a centre comb, burthened
with honey, had separated from its attachments,
and was leaning against another comb, so as to
prevent the passage of the bees between them.
This accident excited great activity in the colony,
but its nature could not be ascertained at the time.
At the end of a week, the weather being cold and
the bees clustered together, Mr. W. observed,
through the window of the box, that they had
constructed two horizontal pillars betwixt the
combs alluded to, and had removed so much of
the honey and wax from the top of each, as to
allow the passage of a bee: in about ten days
more there was an uninterrupted thoroughfare;
the detached comb at its upper part had been
secured by a strong barrier and fastened to the
window with the spare wax. This being accomplished,
the bees removed the horizontal pillars
first constructed, as being of no further use.
&ldquo;During this laborious process,&rdquo; says Mr. W.
"the glass window in the box was as warm as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">- 327 -</a></span>
had felt it during any part of the summer, and
the bees were as active within the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. P. Huber</span> of Lausanne, in his <i>Observations
on Humble-bees</i>, published in the sixth volume of
the Linn&aelig;an Transactions, has given a curious
detail of some experiments in which the bees conducted
themselves somewhat similarly to those of
Mr. Walond. Having inclosed twelve humble-bees
in a bell-glass, upon a table, he gave them
a part of their cones or chrysalids, containing
about ten silken cocoons, and freeing the latter as
much as possible from wax, he fed the bees for
some days with pollen only. The cells containing
the cones being very unequal, the mass was
so unsteady as extremely to disquiet the bees.
Their affection for their young led them to mount
upon the cocoons, to impart warmth to the inclosed
larv&aelig;: they could not do this without
causing the comb to totter or lean on one side, and
having no wax for fastening the work to the table,
they had recourse to the following ingenious expedient.
Two or three bees got upon the comb,
and descending to the lower edge of it, with their
heads downwards, hung from it by the hooks of
their hind feet, and clung to the table by those of
the second pair, which are very long; thus did
they keep this piece of cell-work steady by their
own muscular strength. When fatigued by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">- 328 -</a></span>
constrained and irksome position, they were relieved
by their comrades; even the queen assisted.
Having kept the bees in this state till nearly the
end of the third day, and shown them to several
persons, Huber introduced some honey, to enable
them to form wax: they soon constructed pillars,
extending from the most projecting parts of the
cell-work to the table, and kept the cell-work
in a firm position. The wax, however, getting
gradually dry, the pillars gave way; when the poor
insects adopted their former straining expedient
for steadying the comb, and continued, perseveringly,
to sustain it in this manner, till Huber took
pity on them and glued the cake of comb firmly
to the table. Could the most intelligent architect
have more judiciously propped a tottering edifice,
till adequate supports could be applied?</p>

<p>The resources of bees, when attacked by the
<i>Sphinx Atropos</i> or <i>Death&rsquo;s-head Hawk-moth</i> are
much in point. In this case, according to <span class="smcap">Huber</span>,
they construct small archways and various other
ingenious barricadoes, with a mixture of wax and
propolis, so as just to allow the egress and ingress
of one or two workers, and effectually to exclude
their marauding enemy. The bees do not, as if
guided by mere instinct, commence their fortifications
on the first attack of the Sphinx, nor until
they have been robbed of nearly their whole stock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">- 329 -</a></span>
of honey. This therefore seems to be a case in
which reason is taught by experience, and which
admits in all its particulars of a direct comparison
with human reason and human contrivance.
Moreover, on the cessation of danger, and when
honey-flowers were abundant, the colony prosperous
and swarms prepared to issue, these sagacious
engineers demolished the fortifications, in
order to give room for the exit and entrance of
the bees. A colony that had been thus attacked
in 1804, and was tardy in its defensive preparations,
having derived instruction from the past,
constructed fresh ramparts speedily, on the reappearance
of the Sphinx in 1807, and thus guarded
itself from impending danger.</p>

<p>From what has been said in <a href="#Page_296">page 296</a>, it seems
probable that the lives of the working bees do not
extend beyond a year, at the utmost: if therefore
my inference be legitimate, the information of the
colony of 1807 must have been traditional, or
else derived from a queen which had reigned over
them from 1804. On the subject of traditional
information, see Memory of Bees. It is further
remarkable, as a confirmation of this process of
ratiocination and reflection, that if the apiarian
apply proper guards before the entrances to the
hives, when the Sphinx makes its appearance, the
bees, finding that they are anticipated, devise no
measures of security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">- 330 -</a></span></p>

<p>I shall adduce another instance in support of
my position that insects are endowed with reason,
and that they mutually communicate and receive
information. "<i>A German artist</i> of strict veracity,
states, that in his journey through Italy, he was
an eye-witness to the following occurrence. He
observed a species of <i>Scarab&aelig;us</i> busily engaged,
in making for the reception of its egg a pellet of
dung, which when finished, the insect rolled to the
summit of a hillock, and repeatedly suffered it to
tumble down the slope, apparently for the purpose
of consolidating the pellet by the adhesion of
earth to it in its rotating motion. During this process,
the pellet unluckily fell into a hole, out of
which the beetle was unable to extricate it. After
several ineffectual attempts, the insect went to an
adjoining heap of dung, and soon returned with
three companions. All four applied their united
strength to the pellet, and at length succeeded in
pushing it out, when the three assistant beetles
left the spot, and returned to their own quarters<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span> speaks rather sarcastically, upon
the subject of reason being one of the attributes
of insects. &ldquo;Reason,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;has been ascribed
to bees; they have been supposed to be legislators,
and even mathematicians; and though there is
some show of reason for these suppositions, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">- 331 -</a></span>
much more of imagination.&rdquo; To show how far
the excursive fancy of apiarians had sometimes
carried them, Mr. H. selected a very unfortunate
instance, namely, the assertion, as he calls it, that
workers&rsquo; eggs may be converted into queens,&mdash;a
fact which has since been established by a series
of the most satisfactory experiments. <span class="smcap">Dr. Virey</span>,
in his <i>Nouvelle Dictionnaire d&rsquo;Histoire Naturelle</i>,
denies that insects possess any portion of intellect,
and attributes all their operations to mere instinct,
which he considers as the result of pure mechanism,
depending upon the construction of their
nervous systems, in the same manner as the tune
played upon a barrel organ, is dependent on the
notes which the cylinder successively presents to
its keys. <span class="smcap">Des Cartes</span>, and others before him,
held a similar opinion, considering insects as being
simply susceptible of external impressions, and
through the medium of that susceptibility stimulated
to act. If this doctrine be correct, instinct
is possessed alike by animals and vegetables; in
short by every thing that has life, the difference
being not in quality, but in quantity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffon</span> attempted to explain the ph&aelig;nomena
of insect life by the simple laws of mechanism,
conceding to the insects at the same time a power
of distinguishing and choosing between pleasure
and pain. Some have even ventured to assert
that the invariable exactness of the cell-work
of bees is a proof of their stupidity, and &ldquo;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">- 332 -</a></span>
the wonders of the honey&rsquo;d reign,&rdquo; no more bespeak
the agency of mind or intellect, than the
configuration of salts into their respective crystals.</p>

<p>If this theory respecting insects were just, it
should elucidate all the phenomena which it undertakes
to explain, otherwise it is injurious to
science. Examination will prove it to be a mere
hypothetical opinion, ingenious, and at first sight
plausible, but completely unsatisfactory. This
theory is the natural consequence of denying to
insects any portion of intellect, and its erroneousness
is shown by their capability of instruction.
Instinct itself cannot be a purely mechanical process,
or it would be incapable of modification, and
would, under like circumstances, always act in the
same manner. <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Banks&rsquo;s</span> <i>spider</i> that,
on being crippled, changed from a sedentary web-weaver
to a hunter, is an instance of modified instinct<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a>.
The well known fact that birds build
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">- 333 -</a></span>
their nests differently, where climate and other
circumstances require a variation, is another instance.
A <i>dog</i> may be restrained from obeying
its instincts, by the intimidating recollection of a
beating which it had formerly received; a bee,
if alarmed, will quit the nectary of a flower:&mdash;here
the intellect of the creatures <i>counteracts their instincts</i>.
There are other instances in which the
intellect appears to <i>direct the instincts</i>. When the
bee makes excursive flights in quest of pasture,
its senses serve to guide it, and enable it, by the aid
of memory, to retrace its passage home again. At
the conclusion of its outward and homeward journeys,
its instincts immediately begin to operate; in
the one case, teaching it to imbibe nectar, collect
pollen, &amp;c.; in the other, to store and apply those
materials to their respective uses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[Y]</span></a> The account of this spider was sent to <i>Dr. Leach</i> by
<i>Sir Joseph Banks</i>. An interesting history of it is given in the
Linn&aelig;an Transactions, vol. ii. page 393. It had lost five
of its legs, which were afterwards reproduced, but the new
legs were shorter than those for which they were substituted.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Reimar</span> has denied that the lower animals
possess <i>memory</i>, properly so called; and has given
it as his opinion, that they are only influenced
by past events, in consequence of having present
objects before them,&mdash;never by reflection or knowledge
of the past, as being past. But that, with
them, a former impression may be renewed, without
being recollected; that it is thus rendered present
to the imagination, but has no place in the
memory. For arguments and instances in support
of their being endowed with memory, see
<a href="#Page_260">page 260</a>. (Organs of Sensation.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">- 334 -</a></span></p>

<p>The possession of the organs of sense implies
the possession of some portion of intellect, for
without intellect those organs would seem incapable
of being employed to the greatest advantage.
&ldquo;There is this difference,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Mr.
Spence</span>, &ldquo;between intellect in man, and the rest
of the animal creation. Their intellect teaches
them to follow the lead of their senses, and to
make such use of the external world as their appetites
or instincts incline them to,&mdash;and <i>this is
their wisdom:</i> while the intellect of man, being associated
with an immortal principle, and connected
with a world above that which his senses reveal to
him, can, by aid derived from heaven, control those
senses, and render them obedient to the governing
power of his nature; and <i>this is his wisdom</i>.&rdquo;
A distinction has been made, and very properly,
between wisdom and knowledge. The former
alone can be possessed by the lower animals, man
can possess both. The distinction between them
has been very accurately marked by <span class="smcap">Cowper</span>,
though in making it he has confined himself to
man only.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It will, I think, be evident to my readers, from
the general tenour of this chapter, that though I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">- 335 -</a></span>
make a distinction between the instinct and the
reason of bees, I do not confound their reason
with the reason of man. But to obviate all possibility
of misconception, I will at once define
my meaning, when I use the terms insect reason
and instinct.</p>

<p>By <i>reason</i>, I mean the power of making deductions
from previous experience or observation, and,
thereby of adapting means to ends. <i>Instinct</i> I
regard as a disposition and power to perform certain
actions in the same uniform manner, without
reference either to observation or experience.
Those who have attended to this subject, will be
aware that <i>insect reason</i> as above defined, is more
restricted in its functions than <i>the reason of man</i>;
to which is superadded the power of distinguishing
between the true and the false, and, according to
some metaphysicians, between right and wrong.
Reason, in man, has a regular growth, and a slow
progression; all the arts he practises evince skill
and dexterity, proportioned to the pains which
have been taken in acquiring them. In the lower
links of creation, but little of this gradual improvement
is observable; their powers carry them
almost directly to their object. They are perfect,
as <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> says, in all their members and organs
from the very beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every manufacturing art,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Reid</span>,
&ldquo;was invented by some one man, successively improved
and perfected by others; and when thus
perfected, known only by those to whom it has
been taught: while in the arts of animals no individual
can claim the invention. Every animal of
the species has equal skill from the beginning,
without teaching, without experience, or habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both Instinct and Reason,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>,
"appear to lose their intensity, in proportion as
their rays diverge from their proper focus; and
as they are less frequently aroused to action. A
domesticated fowl is furnished with the same apparatus
as her wild sisters on the waste, for rendering
her feathers impenetrable to water: yet,
living principally under cover, she secretes much
less of the oily fluid, destined for that purpose,
and makes, when accidentally wet, a most ridiculous
appearance. The force of instinctive propensities,
when directed to one object, and uninfluenced
by reason, is strongly exemplified in <i>the
idiot bee-eater of Selborne</i>, mentioned by <span class="smcap">Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">- 337 -</a></span>
White</span>, in his <i>History of Selborne</i>. The collected
powers of reason, when concentred in a single
focus, is no less finely instanced in the immortal
<span class="smcap">Newton</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To those readers who have not seen Mr. White&rsquo;s
account of the bee-eater, the following abstract of
it may prove acceptable.</p>

<p>The boy was a resident in Selborne, about the
year 1750. He took great notice of bees from his
childhood, and at length used to eat them. In
summer, his few faculties were devoted to the
pursuit of them, through fields and gardens.
During winter, his father&rsquo;s chimney corner was
his favourite haunt, where he dozed away his time,
in an almost torpid state. Practice made him so
expert, that he could seize honey-bees, humble-bees
or wasps, with his naked hands, disarm them
of their stings, and suck their honey-bags, with
perfect impunity. Sometimes he would store the
bees in bottles, and even in his shirt bosom. He
was the terror of the surrounding bee-keepers,
whose gardens he would enter by stealth, and
rapping on the outsides of their hives, catch the
bees as they came out to see what was the matter.
If in this way he could not obtain a sufficient
number to supply his wants, so passionately fond
was he of honey, that he would sometimes overturn
the hives to get at it. He was accustomed to
hover about the tubs of the mead-makers, to beg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">- 338 -</a></span>
a draught of bee-wine, as he called it. As he
ran about the fields he made a humming noise
with his lips, resembling that of bees. The lad
was lean in his person, and of a cadaverous unhealthy
aspect: he died before he reached the
age of maturity.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">T</span>he</span> combs of a bee-hive comprise a congeries of
hexagonal cells, formed by the bees, as receptacles

specimen of insect architecture. It has attracted
the admiration of the contemplative philosopher

in the naturalist, but also in the mathematician:
so regular, so perfect, is the structure of the cells,
that it satisfies every condition of a refined problem

attempts, he at length succeeded in attaining the

their usual impenetrable curtain, by suspending
themselves from the top of the hive; in short,
he obliged them to build upwards, and was thereby
enabled, by means of a glass window, to watch
every variation and progressive step in the construction
of comb.</p>

<p><i>Each comb in a hive is composed of two ranges
of cells backed against each other: these cells</i>,
looking at them as a whole, may be said to <i>have
one common base</i>, though no one cell is opposed
directly to another. This base or partition between
the double row of cells is so disposed as to form
a pyramidal cavity at the bottom of each, as will
be explained presently. <i>The mouths of the cells</i>,
thus ranged on each side of a comb, <i>open into two
parallel streets</i> (there being a continued series of
combs in every well filled hive). These streets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">- 341 -</a></span>
are sufficiently contracted to avoid waste of room
and to preserve a proper warmth, yet <i>wide enough
to allow the passage of two bees abreast</i>. Apertures
through different parts of the combs are reserved
to form near roads, for crossing from street to
street, whereby much time is saved to the bees.</p>

<p><i>The bees</i>, as has been already observed, <i>build
their cells of an hexangular form, having six
equal sides</i>, with the exception of the first or uppermost
row, the shape of which is an irregular pentagon,
the roof of the hive forming one of the
members of the pentagon, thus:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/page341.png" width="104" height="125" alt="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There are only three possible figures of the
cells,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Reid</span>, &ldquo;which can make them all
equal and similar, without any useless interstices.
These are the equilateral triangle, the square and
the regular hexagon. It is well known to mathematicians
that there is not a fourth way possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">- 342 -</a></span>
in which a plane maybe cut into little spaces that
shall be equal, similar, and regular, without leaving
any interstices.&rdquo; Of these three geometrical
figures, the hexagon most completely unites the
prime requisites for insect architecture. The
truth of this proposition was perceived by <span class="smcap">Pappus</span>,
an eminent Greek philosopher and mathematician,
who lived at Alexandria in the reign of Theodosius
the Great, and its adoption by bees in the
construction of honey-comb was noticed by that
ancient geometrician. These requisites are;</p>

<p>First, &#338;conomy of materials. There are no
useless partitions in a honey-comb, each of the
six lateral pannels of one cell forms also one of
the pannels of an adjoining cell; and of the three
rhombs which form the pyramidal base of a cell,
each contributes one-third towards the formation
of the bases of three opposing cells, the bottom or
centre of every cell resting against the point of
union of three pannels that are at the back of it.</p>

<p>Secondly, &#338;conomy of room; no interstices
being left between adjoining cells.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The greatest possible capacity or internal
space, consistent with the two former desiderata.</p>

<p>Fourthly, &#338;conomy of materials and &#339;conomy
of room produce &#339;conomy of labour. And in addition
to these advantages, the cells are constructed
in the strongest manner possible, considering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">- 343 -</a></span>
quantity of materials employed. Both the sides
and bases are so exquisitely thin, that three or
four placed on each other are not thicker than a
leaf of common writing-paper; each cell, separately
weak, is strengthened by its coincidence
with other cells, and <i>the entrance is fortified with
an additional ledge or border of wax</i>, to prevent
its bursting from the struggles of the bee-nymph,
or from the ingress and egress of the labourers.
This entrance border is <i>at least three times as
thick as the sides of the cell</i>, and thicker at the
angles than elsewhere, which prevents the mouth
of the cell from being regularly hexagonal, though
the interior is perfectly so.</p>

<p>I have just adverted to the ingenuity of the
bees in thickening, and thereby strengthening the
mouths of the cells. <i>Additional strength is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">- 344 -</a></span>
derived from the bees covering the whole surface of
the combs, but more particularly the edges of the
cells, with a peculiar kind of varnish</i>, which they
collect for the purpose. At first the combs are
delicately white, semitransparent, and exceedingly
fragile, smooth but unpolished: in a short time
their surfaces become stronger, and assume more
or less of a yellow tint. The deepening of the colour
of honey-combs has been supposed, by some,
to be the effect of age; and in part it may be: but
it is principally owing to the coat of varnish with
which the bees cover them. This varnish strongly
resembles propolis, appearing to differ from it
only in containing the colouring material which
imparts to wax its yellow hue. The source of
this colouring matter has not been discovered: it
is insoluble in alcohol; but the manufacture of
white wax shows that it is destructible by light.&mdash;But
to return to the construction of the cell-work.</p>

<p><i>The pyramidal basis of a cell is formed by the
junction of three rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped
portions of wax;</i> thus,</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 111px;">
<img src="images/page344.png" width="111" height="125" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">- 345 -</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">the apex of the pyramid being situated where the
three obtuse angles of the lozenges meet. To the
exterior edges and angles are attached the six
pannels or sides of each cell. The apex of each
pyramidal bottom, on one side of a comb, forms
the angles of the bases of three cells on the opposite
side, the three lozenges respectively concurring
in the formation of the bases of the same cells.
This will I hope explain what is meant by &ldquo;each
cell separately weak, being strengthened by coincidence
with others.&rdquo; The bottom of each cell
rests upon three partitions of opposite cells, from
which it receives a great accession of strength.</p>

<p>As it is desirable that the reader should
thoroughly comprehend this subject, I will restate
it in other words.&mdash;The partition which
separates the two opposing rows of cells, and
which occupies, of course, the middle distance
between their two surfaces, is not a plane but a
collection of rhombs, there being three at the
bottom of each cell: the three together form in
shape a flattened pyramid, the basis of which is
turned towards the mouth of the cell; each cell
is in form therefore an hexagonal prism, terminated
by a flattened trihedral pyramid, the three
sides of which pyramid are rhombs, that meet at
the apex by their obtuse angles. The plates underneath,
represent the opposite surfaces of the
pyramidal bases of adjoining cells, and will, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">- 346 -</a></span>
trust, enable the reader to understand the foregoing
description.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/page346.png" width="374" height="203" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The union of the lozenges in one point, in addition
to the support which it is the means of
affording to the three partitions between opposing
cells, is also admirably adapted to receive the
little egg and to concentrate the heat necessary
for its incubation.</p>

<p>Each obtuse angle of the lozenges or rhombs
forms an angle of about 110&deg;, and each acute one,
an angle of about 70&deg;. <span class="smcap">M. Maraldi</span> found by
mensuration that the angles of these rhombs
which compose the base of a cell, amounted to
109&deg; 28&#8242; and 70&deg; 32&#8242;; and the famous mathematician
<span class="smcap">K&#339;nig</span>, pupil of the celebrated Bernouilli,
having been employed for that purpose
by <span class="smcap">M. Reaumur</span>, has clearly shown, by the method
of infinitesimals, that the quantity of these
angles, using the least possible wax, in a cell of
the same capacity, should contain 109&deg; 26&#8242; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">- 347 -</a></span>
70&deg; 34&#8242;. This was confirmed by the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Laurin</span>, who very justly observes, that
the bees do truly construct their cells of the best
figure, and with the utmost mathematical exactness.</p>

<p>The construction of several combs is generally
going on at the same time. No sooner is the
foundation of one laid, with a few rows of cells
attached to it, than a second and a third are
founded on each side, parallel to the first, and so
on, (if the season give encouragement to the
operations of the bees,) till the hive is filled with
their works; the first constructed comb or combs
being always in the most advanced state, and
therefore the first to be completed.</p>

<p><i>The design of every comb is sketched out, and
the first rudiments are laid, by one single bee.</i>
This founder-bee forms a block, out of a rough
mass of wax, drawn partly from its own resources,
but principally from those of other bees, which
furnish materials, in quick succession, from the
receptacles under their bellies, taking out the
plates of wax with their hind feet, and carrying
them to their mouths with their fore-feet, where
the wax is moistened and masticated, till it becomes
soft and ductile.</p>

<span class="i1">Their glossy burdens to the builder throng.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>The architect-in-chief, who lays, as it were, the
first stone of this and each successive edifice,
determines the relative position of the combs, and
their distances from each other: these foundations
serve as guides for the ulterior labours of the
wax-working bees, and of those which sculpture
the cells, giving them the advantage of the margin
and angles already formed.</p>

<p>The expedients resorted to by that ingenious
naturalist, <span class="smcap">Huber</span>, unfolded the whole process.
He saw each bee extract with its hind feet one
of the plates of wax from under the scales where
they were lodged, and carrying it to the mouth,
in a vertical position, turn it round; so that every
part of its border was made to pass, in succession,
under the cutting edge of the jaws: it was thus
soon divided into very small fragments; and a
frothy liquor was poured upon it from the tongue,
so as to form a perfectly plastic mass. This
liquor gave the wax a whiteness and opacity
which it did not possess originally, and at the
same time rendered it tenacious and ductile.
The issuing of this masticated mass from the
mouth was, no doubt, what misled Reaumur, and
caused him to regard wax as nothing more than
digested pollen.</p>

<p>The mass of wax, prepared by the assistants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">- 349 -</a></span>,
is applied by the architect-bee to the roof or
bottom of the hive, as the case may be; and thus
a block is raised of a semi-lenticular shape, thick
at top and tapering towards the edges. When of
sufficient size, a cell is sculptured on one side of
it, by the wax-working bees, who relieve one
another in succession, sometimes to the number
of twenty, before the cell is completely fashioned.
At the back and on each side of this first cell,
two others are sketched out and excavated. By
this proceeding the foundations of two cells are
laid, the line betwixt them corresponding with
the centre of the opposite cell. As the comb
extends, the first excavations are rendered deeper
and broader; and when a pyramidal base is finished,
the bees build up walls from its edges, so as to
complete, what may be called, the prismatic part
of the cell. Every succeeding row of cells is
formed by precisely similar steps, until there is
sufficient scope for the simultaneous employment
of many workers.</p>

<p>The pyramidal bases and lateral plates are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">- 350 -</a></span>
successively formed, with surprising rapidity: the
latter are lengthened as the comb proceeds, for
the original semi-lenticular form is preserved till
towards the last, when if the hive or box be filled,
the sides of all the cells receive such additions as
give them equal depth.</p>

<p><i>The cells intended for the drones</i> are considerably
larger, and more substantial, than those for the
working bees, and, being later formed, usually
appear near the bottom of the combs. Last of all
are built the <i>royal cells</i>, the cradles of the infant
queens: of these there are usually three or four,
and sometimes ten or twelve, in a hive, attached
commonly to the central part, but not unfrequently
to the edge or side of the comb. <span class="smcap">Mr. Hunter</span>
says that he has seen as many as thirteen royal
cells in a hive, and that they have very little wax
in their composition, not one-third, the rest he
conceives to be farina. Such is the genuine loyalty
of bees, that the wax which they employ with so
much geometric &#339;conomy, in the construction of
hexagonal cells, is profusely expended on the
mansions of the royal bee-nymph, one of these
exceeding in weight a hundred of the former.
They are not interwoven with them, but suspended
perpendicularly, their sides being nearly
parallel to the mouths of the common cells,
several of which are sacrificed to support them.</p>

<p>The form of these royal cells is an oblong
spheroid, tapering gradually downwards, and
having the exterior full of holes, somewhat resembling
the <i>rustic</i> work of stone buildings. The
mouth of the cell, which is always at its bottom,
remains open till the maggot is ready for transformation,
and is then closed as the others are.</p>

<p>Immediately on the emergence of a ripened
queen, the lodge which she inhabited is destroyed,
and its place is supplied by a range of common
cells. The site of this range may always be
traced, by that part of the comb being thicker
than the rest, and forming a kind of knot; sometimes
the upper portion of the cell itself remains,
like an inverted acorn-cup, suspended by its
short peduncle.</p>

<p>In this mutilated state only, and not in the
breeding season, could Mr. Hunter have seen this
cradle of royalty; for he describes it as the half
of an oval, too wide and shallow to receive its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">- 352 -</a></span>
supposed tenant. The following sketch affords;
a representation of the hexagonal cells of a comb,
and also the attachment of the royal cradles.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/page352.png" width="349" height="313" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have spoken of the perfect regularity in the
cell-work of a honey-comb;&mdash;particular circumstances,
however, induce a departure from this
exactness: for instance, where bees have commenced
a comb with small cell-work, and afterwards
wish to attach to it a set of large cells, as
in the case of drone-cells being required to be
appended to workers-cells. These deviations
from the usual regularity renew our admiration
of bee-ingenuity, though Reaumur and Bonnet
have regarded them as examples of imperfection.
They effect their object by interposing three or
four series of, what may be called, <i>cells of transition</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">- 353 -</a></span>
the bottoms or bases of which are composed
of two rhombs and two hexagons, instead of three
rhombs; the rhombs and hexagons gradually
varying in form and relative proportion, till the
requisite size, namely that of the cells which they
are approaching, has been attained. The following
outlines will serve to convey to the reader the
regular steps in this progressive increase.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/page353.png" width="412" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same gradation is observed when returning
to smaller cells. Every apparent irregularity is
therefore determined by a sufficient motive, and
forms no impeachment of the sagacity of the
bee.</p>

<p>The common breeding-cells of drones or workers
are, occasionally, (after being cleaned,) made the
depositories of honey; but the cells are never made
so clean, as to preserve the honey undeteriorated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">- 354 -</a></span>
The finest honey is stored in new cells, constructed
for the purpose of receiving it, their configuration
resembling precisely the common breeding-cells:
these <i>honey-cells vary in size</i>, being made more
or less capacious, <i>according to the productiveness
of the sources from which the bees are collecting</i>,
and <i>according to the season of the year</i>: the cells
formed in July and August vary in their dimensions
from those that are formed earlier; being
intended for honey only, they are larger and
deeper, the texture of their walls is thinner, and
they have more dip or inclination: this dip diminishes
the risk of the honey&rsquo;s running out,
which from the heat of the weather, and the consequent
thinness of the honey, at this season of the
year, it might otherwise be liable to do. <i>When
the cells</i>, intended for holding the winter&rsquo;s provision,
are filled, <i>they are always closed with waxen
lids</i>, and never re-opened till the whole of the
honey in the unfilled cells has been expended.
The waxen lids are thus formed;&mdash;The bees first
construct a ring of wax within the verge of the
cell, to which other rings are successively added,
till the aperture of the cell is finally closed with
a lid composed of concentric circles.</p>

<p>The brood-cells, when their tenants have attained
a certain age, are also covered with waxen
lids, like the honey-cells; the lids differ a little,
the latter being somewhat concave, the former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">- 355 -</a></span>
convex. <i>The depth of the brood-cells</i> of drones
and working bees is about half an inch; <i>their diameter</i>
is more exact, that of the drone-cells being
3&#8531; lines<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>, that of the workers 2&#8535; lines. These,
says Reaumur, are the invariable dimensions of
all the cells, that ever were, or ever will be
made.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> A line is the twelfth part of an inch.</p></div>

<p>From this uniform, unvarying diameter of the
brood-cells, when completed, their use has been
suggested, as an universal standard of measure,
which would be understood, in all countries, to
the end of time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption2">AN INQUIRY INTO THE SOURCE AND
NATURE OF BEES-WAX.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">I</span>t</span> has long been very generally and implicitly
believed, that the yellow matter (in other words,
the pollen or farina of flowers,) which bees visibly
collect upon their thighs, is the prime constituent
of wax, the material of the honey-comb. Even
<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> and <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> were of this opinion. <span class="smcap">Burler</span>,
<span class="smcap">Purchas</span>, <span class="smcap">Rusden</span> and <span class="smcap">Thorley</span> have argued
against its identity with wax; and I trust that
the observations and experiments which I am
about to detail, will convince the dispassionate
inquirer of the fallacy of this old opinion.</p>

<p>In the first place, It is to be observed, that
where no more comb can be built, as in old hives,
the bees carry in the greatest quantity of this
yellow matter.</p>

<p>Secondly, That it differs materially from wax,
the latter when examined between the fingers
being adhesive, the former crumbly; the latter
also liquefying on the application of heat, whilst
the former burns to ashes.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That the wax of new combs, from
whatever source collected, is uniformly white;
whereas the farina, as gathered by the bees, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">- 357 -</a></span>
always black, yellow, or red, agreeing in colour
with the anther-dust of the flowers in blossom at
the time of its collection. Moreover, the farina,
after it has been stored in the cells, retains its
original colour, whilst wax invariably changes,
first to a yellow, and lastly to a blackish tint.
Layers of different-coloured farina are generally
found in the cells, if slit down; and every hive,
at the season of deprivation, possesses a store
of it.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That fresh colonies carry in very
little, if any, of this matter, for some days after
swarming, though combs are formed within that
period. I noticed this fact in my first colony:
the swarm issued from the parent hive on the
18th of May;&mdash;five days of rainy weather succeeded:
during this period the bees were prevented
from flying abroad; I fed them nightly
with sugared ale, and before the return of fine
weather a considerable quantity of comb was
formed. Now excepting such materials as the
bees might have brought with them from the
parent hive, in this case, the sugared ale alone
must have been the source of the wax. <span class="smcap">Huish</span>
has remarked that unless bees have access to
water, and also to sugar or honey, no comb can
be formed. Again, it may be observed, that upon
the storifying plan, when fresh works are commenced
in the duplets or triplets, if the farina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">- 358 -</a></span>
were the basis of the combs, an increased quantity
should be carried in. On the contrary, though
I have watched the bees very minutely on these
occasions, I scarcely ever witnessed the introduction
of farina; and in such rare instances as I did
observe it, it might fairly be regarded as food for
the young larv&aelig; of the bees contained in the full
box or boxes.</p>

<p>The observations of <span class="smcap">Mr. John Hunter</span> tended
to confirm this view of the matter; still more so,
those of <span class="smcap">M. Huber</span> and <span class="smcap">Son</span>. In order to determine
the point with greater precision, Huber
instituted many experiments. He lodged a recent
swarm in a straw-hive, leaving at its disposal only
a sufficiency of honey and water for its consumption,
and preventing it from going beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">- 359 -</a></span>
precincts of a room, so closed as to admit only a
renewal of the air. At the end of five days as
many cakes of beautifully white, though very
fragile wax, were suspended from the roof; the
honey had totally disappeared. Still however, as
there was a possibility that the thighs and stomachs
of the bees might have conveyed pollen
from the parent hive, he withdrew these five
combs, and replaced the bees in the hive with a
fresh supply of honey and water; they renewed
their toil with unabated industry, and soon fabricated
new combs: these last were taken from them;
when the patient and indefatigable insects commenced
a third structure of comb. Five times
in succession were their works thus completed
and removed, although during the whole of this
period they were fed merely with honey and
water, and could not possibly have had access to
farina.</p>

<p>These experiments, so uniform in their results,
give indubitable validity to the fact,&mdash;that honey,
through the organic intervention of bees, may be
converted into wax. A contrary experiment was
made, by abundantly supplying a hive with fruit
and pollen only: but during eight days confinement
the bees produced no wax whatever, nor
exhibited any plates under their abdominal rings;
no combs were formed, nor was an atom of farina
touched,&mdash;a clear proof that farina supplies neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">- 360 -</a></span>
wax nor sustenance to adult bees. The improbability
of this indeed is evinced by its abundance
in hives whose tenants have died of famine. And
as to its being the constituent of wax, <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>
calculated that a well stocked hive might
collect at least 100 pounds of pollen in a season,
whereas the weight of wax fabricated in the same
time would not exceed two pounds.</p>

<p>Experiments have proved the excellence of
sugar as a substitute for honey, and in some instances
its superiority for the formation of wax.
It might otherwise have been supposed that bees
might form comb from some particles of wax
accidentally present in the honey, and that these
afforded the pabulum for this secretion. To prove
therefore that the saccharine principle alone enabled
the bees to produce wax, being still confined,
they were supplied with a syrup made with Canary-sugar
and water, and at the same time
comparative experiments were made in another
hive, where the bees were fed on honey and
water. The syrup-fed bees produced wax sooner
and more abundantly than the honey-fed bees.
Another fact was also incontrovertibly elicited;
namely, that in the old hives the honey is warehoused,
and that in the new ones it is consumed
and transmuted into wax.</p>

<p>The experiments of <span class="smcap">Huber</span> have been confirmed
by those of <span class="smcap">M. Blondelu</span>, of Noyau,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">- 361 -</a></span>
who addressed a memoir upon this subject to the
Society of Agriculture at Paris, in May 1812.
<span class="smcap">Huish</span> has critically examined these experiments
of Huber, but without being convinced by them:
for having observed pollen on the thighs of bees
when swarming, and upon dissection, in their
stomachs also, he considers that pollen, elaborated
in the second stomach of the bee, &ldquo;contains
in itself the principle of wax.&rdquo; Were this the
case, what a store of pollen must the bees have
reserved, in Huber&rsquo;s experiments, wherein they
formed five successive sets of comb, without access
to fresh pollen! The pollen or bee-bread, which
Huish discovered on the thighs and in the stomachs
of some of his bees, was most likely intended
for larva-food; they were probably bees
that had been abroad, and joined the swarm on
their passage home, before they had deposited
their freight in the parent hive. With this pollen
(or ambrosia, as it has been called), after conversion
into a sort of whitish jelly by the action of the
bee&rsquo;s stomach, where it is probably mixed with
honey, and then regurgitated, the young brood,
immediately upon their exclusion and until their
change into nymphs, are fed by the nursing-bees
several times a day. The opinion that
pollen is the prime constituent of wax was held
by <span class="smcap">Buffon</span>, and remains uncontradicted in an
edition of his Works so late as 1821. <span class="smcap">Arthur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">- 362 -</a></span>
Dobbs</span>, Esq., in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1752, instead of considering wax as digested
pollen discharged from the stomach of the bee,
regards it as being emitted <i>per annum</i>; and as he
speaks of its discharge in husks or shells, doubtless
he saw it in that form, which it is now
known to assume when moulded upon the body
of the bee. Indeed he says that he has had swarming
bees alight upon his hand, and drop warm
wax upon it. Its being secreted only by the under
side of the belly might easily deceive, and lead
him to regard it as alvine excrement.</p>

<p>I will here subjoin some more proofs of the
non-identity of wax and pollen. So long ago as
1768, the <span class="smcap">Lusatian Society</span> (called <i>Société des
Abeilles</i>, founded at little Bautzen, a village in
Upper Lusatia, under the auspices of the Elector
of Saxony,) knew that wax was not discharged
from the mouths of bees, but was secreted in thin
scales among their abdominal rings or segments.
About 1774, <span class="smcap">Mr. Thorley</span> caught a bee just
entering its hive, and found, among the plaits of
its belly, no less than six pieces or scales of solid
wax, perfectly white and transparent, and he
oftentimes saw wax in the same situation. <span class="smcap">M.
Duchet</span>, in his <i>Culture des Abeilles</i>, quoted by
<span class="smcap">Wildman</span> in 1778, declares that wax is formed
of honey; and relates in proof of it, that he has
seen a broken comb of an overset hive, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">- 363 -</a></span>
was repaired during bad weather, when the bees
could not acquire any other material. This statement
of Duchet corresponds with my own observation,
as stated in <a href="#Page_357">page 357</a>, but is not so conclusive.
In Duchet&rsquo;s instance there might have
been other materials in the hive besides honey;
whereas in my case the bees had access to no materials
whatever, excepting the sugared ale and the
honey which they had conveyed from the parent
hive, the swarm having been just hived. <span class="smcap">Wildman</span>,
in his Treatise on the Management of Bees,
states his having seen pieces of wax, like fish
scales, on the hive floor of a fresh swarmed
colony, part of which he thinks must at least
have been formed upon the body of the bee; some
flakes might have fallen from the combs then
constructing, but there were many pieces among
them which were concave on one side and convex
on the other, as if moulded on the insect&rsquo;s
belly. Flakes were likewise seen, hanging loose,
between the abdominal scales of the bees. In
1792, <span class="smcap">Mr. John Hunter</span>, apparently unacquainted
with antecedent conjectures, detected the genuine
reservoir of wax under the bee&rsquo;s belly.
He considered wax as an external secretion of
oil, formed and moulded between the abdominal
scales of the insect. <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span> confirms the
testimony of Wildman and Hunter, having been
an eye-witness to the formation of wax into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">- 364 -</a></span>
flakes. &ldquo;One or more bees,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;may
be often seen before the door of the hive, supporting
themselves by their two fore-feet, fluttering
their wings, and agitating the hind parts of
their bodies. They are then evidently moulding
the wax between their abdominal scales, the motion
of the wings serving to preserve their balance, and
as a signal for their companions within to come
and carry off the falling flakes.&rdquo; In the Philosophical
Transactions for 1807, <span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span> states
that there is no such secretory process; that the
wax is laid on the scales of the abdomen for the
convenience of carriage, and to receive warmth
preparatory to cell-building.</p>

<p>To complete the evidence however, to me so
irresistible, in favour of the wax-secreting faculty
of the bee&rsquo;s body, I observe finally, that in 1793,
M. Huber&rsquo;s observations led him to the same
conclusion as Mr. Hunter&rsquo;s, relative to the nature
of the lamin&aelig; under the abdominal scales: but
Huber slumbered not there, he prosecuted the
inquiry more successfully than any preceding naturalist,
and at length demonstrated the secreting
organs which had eluded the scrutiny of Swammerdam,
Hunter, and other acute anatomists.
He found that these lamin&aelig; were contained
in distinct receptacles, on each side of the
middle process of the scales; he examined with
great care the form and structure of these secreting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">- 365 -</a></span>
cavities, which are peculiar to working
bees. Each working bee has eight of these organs,
sacklets or small compartments. Their
general shape is an irregular pentagon, and the
plates of wax, being moulded in them, exhibit
accordingly the same form. A perforation of
their lining membrane on the side next to the
abdomen, started a jet of transparent fluid, which
congealed on cooling; in this state it resembled
wax, and became again fluid on the application
of heat. Comparative experiments were made
with the substance contained in the pouches and
with the wax of fresh combs: a great similarity
between these two substances was discerned;
the latter appeared somewhat more compound,
having probably received some additional ingredient,
while employed as the material for
building. The secreting function of the membrane
on the inner surface of these cavities, was
further evinced, by a more minute examination
of its structure, which exhibited a number of
folds, forming an hexagonal net-work, analogous
to the inner coat of the second stomach of ruminating
quadrupeds. Huber does not appear
to have known the observations either of Duchet
or of Wildman on this subject, although they
were made long prior to Mr. Hunter&rsquo;s; for he
quotes only from the latter.</p>

<p>When combs are wanted, bees fill their crops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">- 366 -</a></span>
with honey, and retaining it in them, hang together
in a cluster from the top of the hive, and remain
inactive about twenty-four hours. During this
time the wax is secreted, and may be seen in
lamin&aelig;, under the abdominal scales, whence it is
removed by the hind legs of the bee, and transferred
to the fore legs; from them it is taken by
the jaws, and after being masticated as described
in Chap, XXXIV, <a href="#Page_347">page 347</a>, the fabrication of comb
commences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see the wax-pockets in the hive-bee, you
must press the abdomen, so as to cause its distention;
you will then find, on each of the four
intermediate ventral segments, separated by the
carina or elevated central part, two trapeziform
whitish pockets, of a soft membranaceous texture:
on these the lamin&aelig; of wax are formed, in different
states, more or less perceptible<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[AB]</span></a> Kirby and Spence.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Huber</span> and <span class="smcap">Son</span> ascertained that the
office of collecting honey, for the elaboration of
wax, is filled by a particular description of bees
or labourers, to which they have given the name
of <i>wax-workers</i>. These bees are susceptible of an
increase in size, as is evident from the state of
their stomachs, when quite full of honey. Dissection
has shown that their stomachs are more
capacious than those of the bees that are differently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">- 367 -</a></span>
occupied. Bees not possessed of this expanding
stomach, gather no more honey than is
necessary to supply the immediate wants of themselves
and their companions, with whom they
readily share it: these are called <i>nursing-bees</i>,
their principal duty being to attend the eggs and
larv&aelig;. The task of storing the hive with provisions
devolves upon the wax-workers, who,
when not occupied in the construction of comb,
disgorge their honey into those cells which are
intended for its reception. By marking the
bees, it was found that they never encroached
upon each other&rsquo;s employment: this strict adjustment
of duty is the more remarkable, since the
power of producing wax is common both to the
nursing- and wax-working bees, a small quantity
of wax being really found in the receptacles of
the nursing-bees.</p>

<p>In the foregoing experiments for ascertaining
the sources of wax, the bees had borne their confinement
without evincing the least impatience;
but on another occasion, when shut up with a
brood of eggs and larv&aelig;, and without pollen,
though honey was copiously supplied, they manifested
uneasiness and rage at their imprisonment.
Fearing the consequence of this state of tumult
being prolonged, Huber allowed them to escape
in the evening, when too late to collect provisions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">- 368 -</a></span>
the bees soon returned home. At the end of five
days, during which this experiment was tried,
the hive was examined:&mdash;the larv&aelig; had perished,
and the jelly that surrounded them on their introduction
into the hive had disappeared. The
same bees were then supplied with a fresh brood,
together with some comb containing pollen: very
different indeed was their behaviour with this
outfit; they eagerly seized the pollen and conveyed
it to the young; order and prosperity were
re-established in the colony; the larv&aelig; underwent
the usual transformations; royal cells were completed
and closed with wax, and the bees showed
no desire to quit their habitation. These experiments
afford indisputable evidence of the origin
of wax and the destination of pollen.</p>

<p>Though the wax of honey and brood-comb
be an original secretion from the body of the bee,
wax is also considered by some as a vegetable
substance existing abundantly in nature. According
to <span class="smcap">Proust</span>, it forms the silvery down on
the leaves, flowers and fruit of many plants, and
resides likewise in the fecul&aelig; of others. <span class="smcap">Dr.
Darwin</span>, in his <i>Phytologia</i>, supposes that wax is
secreted to glaze over the fecundating dust of the
anthers, and prevent its premature explosion
from excessive moisture: to an unseasonable
dispersion of anther-dust he ascribes the failure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">- 369 -</a></span>
of orchard and corn crops in summers of extreme
humidity. The wax-tree of Louisiana<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> (<i>Myrica
cerifera</i>) contains immense quantities of wax. In
this respect there appears an identity betwixt
animal and vegetable secretion, which may be
viewed as indicative of simplicity in the structure
of the bee: a still simpler organization exists in
the aphis, which extracts the saccharine juices
from the leaves and bark of trees, and expels
them again nearly unchanged<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a>.</p>

<p class="caption2">POLLEN.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><i><span class="big">P</span>ollen</i></span> and <i>Farina</i>, in the language of Botanists,
are terms applied to the powdery particles discharged
by the anthers of flowers in warm dry
weather, and which hang about the stamina. The
colour, as well as the structure of pollen, varies
in different plants. Its use, in fecundating the
germens of flowers, is well known: the services
of bees, towards that end, will be noticed in a
separate chapter. The sixth volume of the Linn&aelig;an
Transactions contains an interesting paper
upon this substance, from the pen of <span class="smcap">Mr. Luke
Howard</span>.</p>

<p><i>Pollen has a capsular structure</i>, varying its
shape in different flowers, insomuch as to be a
popular object for the microscope. Each grain
consists commonly of a membranous bag, which,
when it has come to maturity, bursts on the application
of moisture: this bursting is naturally
effected by the honey-like exudation of the stigma;
but if extraneous moisture accomplish it prematurely,
the pollen is rendered useless for the purpose
of fructification. Whenever moistened, the
bag explodes with great force, and discharges a
subtle vapour or essence, which, when released
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">- 371 -</a></span>
by the peculiar moisture of the stigma, performs
effectually its final purpose.</p>

<p>This substance was once erroneously supposed
to be the prime constituent of wax; but the experiments
of <span class="smcap">Hunter</span> and <span class="smcap">Huber</span> have proved
that wax is a secretion from the bodies of wax-working
bees<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a>, and that the principal purpose of
pollen is to nourish the embryo-bees; (it has
been called the ambrosia of the hive). Huber
was the first who suggested this idea, and it well
accords with what we observe among other parts
of the animal kingdom;&mdash;birds, for instance, feed
their young with different food from what they
take themselves. Mr. Hunter examined the stomachs
of the maggot-bees, and found farina in
all, but not a particle of honey in any of them.
Huber considers the pollen as undergoing a peculiar
elaboration in the stomachs of the nursing-bees,
to be fitted for the nutriment of the larv&aelig;.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>&ldquo;In spring,&rdquo; says <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>, &ldquo;which may be
called the bee&rsquo;s first <i>carrying</i> season, scarcely one
of the labourers is seen returning to the hive,
without a little ball or pellet of farina, on each of
its hinder legs. These balls are invariably of the
same colour as the anther-dust of the flowers then
in bloom, the different tints of yellow, as pale,
greenish or deep orange, being most prevalent.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">- 372 -</a></span>The bees may frequently be observed to roll their
bodies on the flower, and then, brushing off the
pollen which adheres to them, with their feet,
form it into two masses, which they dispose of in
the usual way. In very dry weather, when probably
the particles of pollen cannot be made to
cohere, I have often seen them return home so
completely enveloped by it, as to give them the
appearance of a different species of bee. The
anther-dust, thus collected, is conveyed to the interior
of the hive, and there brushed off by the
collector or her companions. <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> and others
have observed, that <i>bees prefer the morning for
collecting this substance</i>, most probably that the
dew may assist them in the moulding of their little
balls. &ldquo;I have seen them abroad,&rdquo; says Reaumur,
&ldquo;gathering farina before it was light;&rdquo; they
continue thus occupied till about ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">And to their nurslings bear the rich supply.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Evans.</span></p></div>

<p>This is their practice during the warmer months;
but in April and May, and at the settlement of
a recent swarm, they carry pollen throughout the
day; but even in these instances, the collection is
made in places most likely to furnish the requisite
moisture for moulding the pellets, namely, in shady
and sometimes in very distant places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">- 373 -</a></span></p>

<p>When a bee has completed her loading, she returns
to the hive, <i>part</i> of her cargo <i>is instantly
devoured</i> by the nursing-bees, to be regurgitated
for the use of the larv&aelig;, and <i>another part is stored</i>
in cells for future exigencies, <i>in the following
manner</i>. The bee, while seeking a fit cell for her
freight, makes a noise with her wings, as if to
summon her fellow-citizens round her; she then
fixes her two middle and her two hind legs upon
the edge of the cell which she has selected, and
curving her body, seizes the farina with her fore
legs, and makes it drop into the cell: thus freed
from her burthen, she hurries off to collect again.
Another bee immediately packs the pollen, and
kneads and works it down into the bottom of the
cell, probably mixing a little honey with it, judging
from the moist state in which she leaves it;
an air-tight coating of varnish finishes this storing
of pollen.</p>

<p>From the uniform colour of each collection, it
is reasonable to suppose that <i>the bee never visits
more than one species of flower on the same journey;</i>
this was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, and the
generality of modern observers have confirmed it.
<span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>, however, supposed that the bee ranged
from flowers of one species to those of another
indiscriminately. <span class="smcap">Mr. Arthur Dobbs</span>, in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1752, states that
he has repeatedly followed bees when collecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">- 374 -</a></span>
pollen; and that whatever flowers they first alighted
upon decided their choice for that excursion, all
other species being passed over unregarded:
<span class="smcap">Butler</span> had previously asserted the same thing.
Here we see the operation of a discriminating instinct,
which in the first place leads the insect to
make an aggregation of homogeneous particles,
which of course form the closest cohesion; and in
the next place prevents the multiplication of
hybrid plants. This remark was made by <span class="smcap">Sprengel</span>,
who has confirmed the observations of Dobbs,
Butler, and others. The bees, which Reaumur
observed to visit flowers of different species,
might have been in quest of honey as well as of
pollen.</p>

<p class="caption2">PROPOLIS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">B</span>esides</span> the honey and pollen which are gathered
by bees, they collect a resinous substance,
that is very tenacious, semitransparent, and which
gives out a balsamic odour, somewhat resembling
that of storax. In the mass, it is of a reddish
brown colour; when broken, its colour approaches
that of wax. Dissolved in spirit of
wine or oil of turpentine, it imparts, as varnish,
a golden colour to silver, tin, and other white
polished metals. Being supposed to possess
medicinal virtue, it was formerly kept in the
shop of the apothecary. According to Vauquelin,
propolis consists of one part of wax and four of
pure resin; in which respect, and in its yielding
the same acid, (the <i>benzoic</i>,) it resembles balsam
Peru. It also contains some aromatic principles.</p>

<p>With propolis, bees attach the combs to the roof
and sides of their dwelling, stop crevices, fasten
the hives or boxes to the floors and roofs, strengthen
the weak places of their domicile, and varnish
the cell-work of their combs. The chapter on
Instincts details the modes in which bees employ
it for their protection against intruders into their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">- 376 -</a></span>
hives. From its being used for the firm attachment
of combs to the roofs of hives, it must be
the first matter collected by a recent swarm. The
term Propolis is derived from the Greek, and
signifies &lsquo;before the city,&rsquo; bees having been observed
to make use of it, in strengthening the
outworks of their city.</p>

<p>Reaumur was unable to discover its vegetable
source. It is generally supposed to be gathered
from the resinous exudations of the poplar, alder,
birch, and willow; according to Riem, from pines
and other trees of the fir tribe; though some authors
have alleged that bees can produce it where
no such trees are near them, and that turpentine
and other resins have been disregarded when
laid before them. A recent experiment of Huber
has solved this question: he planted in spring
some branches of the wild poplar, before the
leaves were developed, and placed them in pots
near his apiary: the bees alighting on them separated
the folds of the largest buds with their forceps,
extracted the varnish in threads, and loaded
with it, first one thigh and then the other; for
they convey it like pollen, transferring it by the
first pair of legs to the second, by which it is lodged
in the hollow of the third. Huber examined the
chemical properties of this varnish, and identified
it with the propolis which fastens the combs to
the hives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">- 377 -</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to the absence of fir-trees, &amp;c. in
the neighbourhood of the hives, it is to be recollected,
in the first place, that <i>bees will fly about
three miles</i> (some say five,) for what they may
want: <span class="smcap">Huber</span> <i>thinks that the radius of the circle
they traverse does not exceed half a league</i>, yet
says that the question is undecided. In the second
place, that a balsamic and tenacious secretion is
found upon the buds of several plants and trees,
which are often crowded with these insects; such
for instance as the tacamahac, horse-chesnut, and
hollyhock. Dr. Evans says that he has been an
eye-witness of their collecting the balsamic varnish
which coats the young blossom buds of the hollyhock,
and has seen them rest at least ten minutes
on the same bud, moulding the balsam with their
fore-feet and transferring it to the hinder legs, as
above stated. When finally moulded, the pellets
of propolis are of a lenticular form.</p>

<p>As to the bees refusing resinous substances,
when presented to them, as substitutes for propolis,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Knight</span> has assured us, in the Philosophical
Transactions, that this is not the fact; as
he had seen them carry off a composition of wax
and turpentine, which had been laid over the decorticated
parts of his trees.</p>

<p>The bees blend this substance with wax in
different proportions, as occasion may require.
Among the ancients, it bore different names, according
to the quantity of wax it contained. Virgil
made this distinction, though <span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span> conceives
that his <i>narcissi lachrym&aelig;</i>, <i>cera</i> [cum quâ]&mdash;&ldquo;spiramenta
tenuia linunt,&rdquo;&mdash;and <i>gluten</i>, all
mean the same thing: this is probably a mistake.
It seems much more likely that <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> should mean
<i>metys</i>, <i>pissoceron</i> and <i>propolis</i>, the three names
by which <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> says that the varieties of propolis
were distinguished in his time.</p>

<p>I have before alluded to the fortification of the
weak places of hives with propolis. M. Reaumur,
whose hives consisted of wooden frames and panes
of glass, wishing to put this talent of the bees to
the test, carelessly fastened the glass of a hive
with paper and paste, before putting in a swarm;
the bees soon discovered the weakness of his
paste-work, and indignantly gnawing to pieces
this feeble fence, secured the glass with their own
cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">- 379 -</a></span></p>

<p>I have already observed, that <i>the sage bee</i>
chooses the morning for collecting pollen, on
account of the dew&rsquo;s enabling her to compress it
better; but, as moisture would render propolis less
coherent, she <i>gathers this substance when the day
is somewhat advanced</i>, and when the warmth of the
sun has imparted to it softness and pliancy. These
qualities are however soon lost, after it has been
detached from the secreting surfaces, and exposed
to the oxygenizing power of the air. So rapid is
this hardening process, that the bees which store
it, oftentimes find some difficulty in tearing it
with their jaws from the thighs of its collectors.</p>

<p class="caption2">IMPORTANCE OF BEES TO THE FRUCTIFICATION OF FLOWERS.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap"><span class="big">H</span>oney</span> is regarded by modern naturalists as of
no other use to plants but to allure insects, which,
by visiting the nectaries of their flowers to procure
it, become instrumental to their fertilization,
either by scattering the dust of the stamens upon
the stigmata of the same flower, or by carrying it
from those which produce only male blossoms to
those that bear female ones, and thereby rendering
the latter fertile.</p>

<p>No class of insects renders so much service in
this way as <i>bees</i>; they <i>have</i> however <i>been accused
of injuring vegetables</i>, in three ways: 1st, by purloining
for their combs the wax which defends
the prolific dust of the anthers from rain; 2ndly,
by carrying off the dust itself, as food for their
young larv&aelig;; and 3dly, by devouring the honey
of the nectaries, intended to nourish the vegetable
organs of fructification<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[AF]</span></a> Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Phytologia</i>.</p></div>

<p>In defence of his insect protegées, <span class="smcap">Dr. Evans</span>
has observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, That the proportion of wax collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">- 381 -</a></span>
from the anthers is probably very trifling, it being
so readily and abundantly obtainable from honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly, That for any depredations committed
on the farina, they amply compensate, by their
inadvertent yet providential conveyance of it, on
their limbs and corslets, to the female organs of
monoecious or dioecious plants; whose impregnation
must otherwise have depended on the uncertain
winds. This is exemplified in the practice
of our gardeners, who in early spring, before
they dare expose their hotbeds to the open air,
and consequently to the access of insects, insure
the fertility of the cucumbers and melons, by
shaking a male blossom over each female flower.
For the same purpose, and with the same success,
a gentleman in Shropshire substitutes a male
blossom, in place of the female one, at the top of
his embryo cucumber, which instantly adheres,
and falls off in due time. To the same kind intrusion
of insects we owe the numberless new
sorts of esculents and endless varieties of flowers
in the parterre:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&lsquo;Where Beauty plays<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her idle freaks; from family diffus&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To family, as flies the father dust<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The varied colours run.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smcap">Thomson.</span></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, That in a great many instances, the
honey-cups are completely beyond the reach of
the fructifying organs, and cannot possibly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">- 382 -</a></span>
subservient to their use. Hence <span class="smcap">Sir J. E. Smith</span>
<i>believes the honey to be intended, by its scent, to allure
these venial panders to the flowers</i>, and thereby
shows how highly he estimates their value to vegetation.
See his Introduction to Botany. In
the same work, the author observes that <span class="smcap">Sprengel</span>
has ingeniously demonstrated, in some hundreds
of instances, how the corolla serves as an attraction
to insects, indicating by various marks, sometimes
perhaps by its scent, where they may find
honey, and accommodating them with a convenient
resting-place or shelter while they extract
it. This elegant and ingenious theory receives
confirmation from almost every flower we examine.
Proud man is disposed to think that</p>

<div class="center">&lsquo;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,&rsquo;</div>

<p class="p0">because he has not deigned to explore it; but we
find that even the beauties of the most sequestered
wilderness are not made in vain. They have
myriads of admirers, attracted by their charms,
and rewarded by their treasures, which would be
as useless as the gold of a miser, to the plant
itself, were they not the means of bringing insects
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the bee, by settling upon and collecting
honey from a thousand different flowers, is
thereby assisting the great purpose of vegetable
reproduction, at the same time that the loads she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">- 383 -</a></span>
carries home enable her to construct receptacles
for the reproduction of her own race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the due fertilization of the common <i>Barberry</i>,
it is necessary that its irritable stamens
should be brought into contact with the pistil, by
the application of some stimulus to the base of
the filament; but this would never take place
were not insects attracted, by the melliferous
glands of the flower, to insinuate themselves
amongst the filaments, and thus, while seeking
their own food, unknowingly to fulfil the intentions
of Nature in another department.&rdquo; <i>In some cases
the agency of the hive-bee is inadequate to produce
the required end; in these the humble-bee is the
operator:</i> these alone, as Sprengel has observed,
are strong enough for instance, to force their way
beneath the style-flag of the <i>Iris Xiphium</i>, which
in consequence is often barren. <i>Other insects
besides bees are instrumental in producing the same
ends;</i> indeed they are necessary instruments: and
hence according to the same naturalist, in some
places, where the particular insect required is not
to be met with, no fruit is formed upon the plant
which is usually visited by it, where it is indigenous;
for he supposes that <i>some plants have particular
insects appropriated to them</i>. The American
<i>Aristolochia Sipho</i>, though it flowers plentifully,
never forms fruit in our gardens, probably for the
reason just assigned. The <i>Date Palm</i> affords a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">- 384 -</a></span>
striking instance of the necessity of extraneous
intervention to perfect fructification; male and
female flowers are borne on separate trees, and
unless the two sorts be in the neighbourhood of
each other, the fruit has no kernel and is not
proper for food. There was a tree of this kind,
bearing female flowers, at Berlin, for the fructification
of which, a branch, with male flowers upon
it, was once sent by post from Leipsic, (20 German
miles,) and being suspended over some of the
pistils, the tree afterwards yielded fruit and seed
in abundance. <span class="smcap">Professor Willdenow</span> has stated
a very curious circumstance, concerning the <i>Aristolochia
Clematitis</i>. He observes that the stamens
and pistils of the flower are inclosed in its globular
base, the anthers being under the stigma, which
thereby requires the intervention of an insect, to
convey the pollen to it. The <i>Tipula pennicornis</i>
accomplishes this object; it enters the
flower by its tubular part, which is thickly lined
with inflected hairs, so as readily to admit the
fly, but totally to prevent its release, till by the
fading of the corolla the hairs have fallen flat
against its sides. Hence the insect in struggling
to effect its escape, brushes off the pollen and applies
it to the stigma, thereby accomplishing the
fertilization of the flower.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
